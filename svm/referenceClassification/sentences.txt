1<>0<>Um.
2<>0<>Yeah.
3<>1<>I didn't think it was nearly astounding as everyone else did.
4<>1<>Cheers: Any of the macarons, especially the raspberry and lemon.
5<>1<>The TKO - super yum!
6<>1<>Almond brioche.
7<>1<>Cheese danish.
8<>1<>Croissant.
9<>1<>Fruit tart, on that crust.
10<>1<>Jeers: The cupcakes were astoundingly boring.
11<>1<>Chocolate was good, but I've had better.
12<>1<>The red velvet was dry and dull.
13<>1<>The carrot cake, I had hopes for you, but they were quickly dashed when it tasted dayold.
14<>1<>I thought it was pretty pricey for average tasting baked goods, especially for all the raves.
15<>1<>Maybe I caught the baked goods on an off day?
16<>1<>Will try again next time in Vegas.
17<>1<>BTW, damn good coffee.
18<>0<>I should sue for false advertisement.
19<>1<>The bag listed only 3 locations of Bouchon but then I come to find out that there are 5 locations (2 in NYC, 1 in Vegas, and 1 in LA).
20<>1<>This bakery is hidden (at least in my eyes) because it is located behind and underneath the escalator at Venetian!
21<>1<>If I recall correctly, I saw pastries (croissants, danishes, muffins), sandwiches (ham and Swiss baguettes), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, eclairs, and what I came for: macaroons.
22<>1<>Macaroons sell at $3 a piece however, I must admit that they are huge and I should have opted that route however, being the fatty that I am, I bought a pack of mini macaroons for $13 (all flavors: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel).
23<>1<>The macaroons were light, fluffy, and smooth (the filling)...
24<>1<>I can't describe it in words that can fully justify the macaroons but I reckon I will be back every time I am in Vegas simply because I work hard and workout hard so $13 for a pack of macaroons that I can devour entirely in less than 24 hours?
25<>0<>Hell to the yes.
26<>1<>I should have bought 2 for the plane ride home.
27<>1<>I love this place.
28<>1<>The pastry's are top notch.
29<>1<>I especially love the ham n cheese croisants and also the strawberry croisants.
30<>1<>They're amazing.
31<>1<>Get there early cuz those items sell out quick.
32<>0<>I wanted to grab breakfast here and ended up buying a few snacks for later in our day.
33<>1<>Not many options but what we had was great.
34<>1<>Very hard to find, though!
35<>1<>Worst French macarons I have ever had.
36<>1<>They were so stale that we went back to get a new one.
37<>1<>They told us they were between 2-4 days old and had no idea which ones were recently made.
38<>1<>The second one we got was harder than the first.
39<>1<>We just threw them out.
40<>1<>They brought shame to such an exquisite treat.
41<>1<>However, the guys at the bakery were very nice.
42<>0<>Shortly after landing in Vegas Friday morning I rushed over to the Venetian for a mid morning snack and cappuccino from Bouchon Bakery.
43<>1<>The bakery was tricky to find but it was worth every step I took to get there.
44<>1<>The walk-up bakery has a great display of French-influenced baked goods.
45<>0<>I was lucky to beat the mid-morning rush.
46<>1<>Shortly after ordering the barista commented on how perfectly dry the cappuccino was.
47<>1<>She handed me my drink and a precisely baked pain au chocolate, that had a golden brown and flaky exterior that was filled with warm, rich chocolate.
48<>1<>Not that I needed to, but I couldn't resist ordering something for the road.
49<>1<>I chose a soft and chewy, buttercream filled, lemon macaron that turned out to be a delicious way to finish my snack.
50<>1<>Bouchon Bakery was a great way to start my Vegas weekend.
51<>1<>I had perfect timing beating the rush; they had perfect service; a perfect cappuccino; and perfect baked goods.
52<>0<>In no time after finishing my first few bites, a dozen or so people came charging in to experience the expertly crafted and enticing display of Bouchon's baked goods.
53<>1<>It is unfortunate that this is just an elevator ride from my room.
54<>1<>The beignets are YUM, I want to try it ALL!
55<>1<>Bouchon Bakery is one of those "pilgrimage" bakeries that you must visit at least once a year (or once a month if you're an LV native for all I'm concerned).
56<>1<>Their macarons are crazy delicious and are really large like the rest of the pastries there.
57<>1<>I would personally recommend getting (in addition to a box of macarons) the chocolate croissant, the chocolate bouchons, and the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo).
58<>1<>first had my taste of bouchon while staying at the venetian.. how convenient that this amazing kiosk of goodies is next to the elevators?
59<>1<>tried.. -choc bouchons  -choc tarts -tko -carrot cake cookie  -macarons im sure i had a few more things but dont remember them.. they were all oh so delicious  on my next trip, i was in vegas for a convention and on the last night i made sure to take a lil trip here to pick up a box of goodies.. did i really just spend $50+?
60<>0<>yes, i did!
61<>1<>sooo worth it.. i want some more of you now!
62<>1<>Like many other reviewers have stated: the macaroons are amazing.
63<>1<>Don't miss this stop in Las Vegas!
64<>1<>The best Octopus I have ever had!
65<>1<>The Grilled Octopus with 'Borlotti Marinati' and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette was unbelievable!
66<>1<>If I only  came to eat just that, then my trip to this restaurant would be fulfilled.
67<>0<>I typically never eat octopus, unless someone else orders for me or to be shared in a group.
68<>1<>My wife and I were influenced by our waiter who highly recommended this appetizer.
69<>1<>However a warning, that this octopus is not your typical rubbery texture, if that is what you are expecting do not order this fine, exquisite dish of enjoyment.
70<>1<>Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail was fantastic and was reminiscent of the flavors we experienced in Sienna Italy.
71<>1<>If you have had oxtail before I would highly recommend this dish.
72<>1<>If you have never had oxtail, then step out of your comfort zone and try this dish.
73<>1<>Oxtail is dish that I would typically only order in Italy, however this homemade gnocchi with perfectly chunks of shredded braised oxtail encased with a strong pungent flavored  sauce.
74<>1<>The gnocchi was obviously homemade and perfectly prepared.
75<>1<>Wild Alaskan King Salmon with Agretti and Almonds was way too salty for my tastes, however it was not over cooked.
76<>0<>My FAVS: 1.
77<>1<>Grilled Octopus with 'Borlotti Marinati' and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette - a must order!
78<>0<>Pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-hUvO0C0A-pGZdiSKvjoFw?select=5ATc2lLZ-fg0ljIgLvjrlw  this dish is served at other Mario Batali restaurants - Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles CA & Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca in New York NY.
79<>0<>2.
80<>1<>Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail - I would order this anytime!
81<>0<>3.
82<>1<>Dessert: Chocolate Strawberry Torta with Strawberry Sorbetto - great for chocolate lovers.
83<>0<>The Bônet with Lavender Flowers I heard is terrific.
84<>0<>4.
85<>1<>Cappuccino - was so terrific, I had to order 2.
86<>0<>It was hard to find a decent cap in Vegas.
87<>1<>Service was excellent, we asked to be re-seated in another area and it was not problem.
88<>1<>I recommend a cozy booth/table.
89<>0<>We sat next to a wonderful group of people that turned out were from a neighboring town back home.
90<>1<>They enjoyed the Bônet with Lavender Flowers - dessert.
91<>1<>Recommendations: If you love wine, get a reservation and have them decant your favorite wine ahead of time.
92<>1<>A wonderful selection of Brunello De Montalcino, obviously any from 97 "year of the gods", or a 99, or 01.
93<>1<>On a budget, order the Morellino di Scansano, Perazzi La Mozza 2006 Toscana which I think is from one of Mario's vineyard in Tuscany.
94<>1<>$$$ to $$$$ If you are ordering wine and dessert, it is more so $$$$.
95<>0<>My wife and I ate at B&B a few years ago, so my review is based on that experience.
96<>1<>By some accounts, some of Mario Batali's kitchens are flagging a skosh in their quality.... that was most assuredly *not* the case when I dined at B&B.
97<>1<>The meal was a progression of flavors and textures unlike few I have ever enjoyed, yet at its core there remained a solid 'Italian' foundation.
98<>1<>Service was outstanding (something that I've found to be the exception rather than the rule at many of the Vegas outposts of celebrity chef's empires), and the sommelier gracious and helpful.
99<>1<>Beef cheek ravioli, sweetbreads, rabbit.... and those exquisite veal chops!
100<>1<>B&B is, along with the newer Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles, very much 'Babbo West' in its style and execution.
101<>1<>Would gladly return there in a heartbeat.
102<>1<>we stumbled across b&b after avoiding several other upscale restaurants for their vegetarian-hostile menus.
103<>1<>from the outside, it's just like any other vegas restaurant.
104<>1<>inside, the tables are so wide, it's uncomfortable to hold hands or play footsies.
105<>1<>fortunately, i was dining with my best friend, so the wide table simply gave us room for plenty of food.
106<>1<>they started us with a complimentary taste of some sort of chickpea and olive oil concoction atop a slice of baguette.
107<>1<>tasty, though messy.
108<>1<>the appetizer was completely forgettable.
109<>1<>it sounded italian on the menu, though looked and tasted just like tempura.
110<>1<>we opted to leave some on the plate to save room for the main course.
111<>1<>we shared two raviolis - the sweet potato and the goat cheese.
112<>1<>this wonderful combination left us satisfied beyond ordering dessert.
113<>0<>they say two people should order five plates to share.
114<>1<>i cannot fathom the food coma that would have left us in.
115<>1<>the service is good.
116<>1<>our water glasses never ran dry, the food came at a pace to match ours, and, despite feeling underdressed, the waitress never rushed us out our did anything to indicate that she'd noticed.
117<>1<>One of the best dining experiences i have ever had.
118<>0<>Note I said dining experiences.
119<>1<>Yes, I may have had a better meal, but from making the reservations to paying the bill, B&B is one of the best.
120<>0<>We arrived to B&B about 10 minutes early of 5pm since we had a 7pm show to make.
121<>1<>We sat at the bar and enjoyed a craft made "Smoked Potato and Rosemary" Martini that was like an amuse on its own.
122<>1<>A perfect starter prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender.
123<>1<>We were seated at 5pm, with our waiter already informed of our time line.
124<>1<>He started with a great introduction and briskly informed us of the best choices that we could manage.
125<>1<>Any questions were answered with detail and a reassurance that you were making the correct decision.
126<>1<>He also noticed that my wife was pregnant and offered a custom "Mocktail" for her.
127<>1<>ANTIPASTI:  Warm Lamb's Tongue with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg $17 - a great balance of pickling, tender, and savory bites that come to life the second you break that egg yolk.
128<>1<>PRIMI:  Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver $26 - a classic Batali dish that emphasizes texture and the control of flavor.
129<>1<>The mixture of duck liver was and beef cheek was fantastic, with the liver just adding that necessary mineral, woodsy accent.
130<>1<>Goat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen $25 - Just an awesome dish.
131<>1<>The goat cheese filling was so creamy and smooth.
132<>1<>Again, no single ingredient over shadowed the other, the all play together perfectly, exciting your palate with every bite.
133<>1<>SECONDI:  Crispy Polenta Sweetbreads with Favas, Oyster Mushrooms and Spring Garlic "Fonduta" $36 - A great dish executed with a delicate touch.
134<>1<>The sweetbreads where simply creamy inside their crispy thin crust.
135<>1<>The favas, mushrooms, and "fonduta" simply created a lovely sauce coating eat morsel.
136<>1<>Paired with a recommended glass of red wine that I wish I could remember, perfect.
137<>0<>We had to skip desert, but the choice was difficult.
138<>1<>PS - Love the 80's music playing in the background.
139<>1<>It does make it seem so uptight and snooty.
140<>1<>Someone gets it; great food, proper attire, in a relaxed atmosphere works wonders.
141<>1<>$$$$ if you are a proper patron.
142<>1<>I want to give it negative stars if that is an option but it isn't.
143<>1<>The worst dining experience ever.
144<>0<>Went with a group of girlfriends for dinner.
145<>1<>Had no choice but to order pre-fixed menu.
146<>1<>The skirt steak was the saltiest dish I've ever had.
147<>1<>It was so salty we could not eat it.
148<>0<>So we asked the waiter to either remake it or change to some other dish.
149<>1<>The waiter got all defensive and reluctantly said ok.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food in the first place, but second time around, we had to wait even longer!!!
150<>1<>And when it came out for the second time, it was still too salty and this time the meat was overcooked.
151<>1<>Some of us who opted for quail instead, still had to deal with overcooked meat.
152<>1<>The manager nor waiter never came by to see if we needed anything...they did not even apologize for our inconvenience.
153<>1<>Dessert came so much faster than our coffee...and the biscottis came after we were done with the coffee.
154<>1<>To top it all off, our bill was overcharged by $150!!!!
155<>1<>After the meal, manager (ANDREW) finally came since he had to due to their incompetant math skills, he was unapologetic and gave excuses to every comment we made.
156<>1<>We explained that food being salty can happen but we were more upset about the service, he walked away from us while we were STILL talking!!!
157<>1<>What kind of manager treats their unhappy customers this way.
158<>1<>It was unbelievably immature behavior coming especially from a MANAGER of a professional restaurant...who was supposedl train to oversee the customer to have the best dining experience?
159<>1<>mario batali should be ashamed of such horrible management of his restaurant.
160<>1<>RUDE STAFF, TERRIBLE FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE and IMMATURE MANAGER   By far the worst dining experience ever and will never go back or let anyone I care about to waste their money/time here.
161<>1<>SALT - If they could just ease up a tad on this condiment, all would be right.
162<>1<>Love the decor - truly beautiful taste in furniture.
163<>0<>It would have been romantic, but I was with my best girl - and I promised her I wouldn't hit on her while we were in vegas.
164<>1<>;) Loved the service - we were welcomed warmly and made to feel at home immediately.
165<>1<>Our server knew when to stay away and when to come back.
166<>1<>Lovely portions of wine - knowing most people want a little more than a glass.
167<>1<>But here's the funny part - our server says we should pick something from each part of the menu - and there is NO WAY either of us could have eaten that much food.
168<>1<>R and I each had a small salad and pasta entrees.
169<>1<>There was no way we could have had a main course.
170<>1<>The pasta was delicious.
171<>0<>So I actually went like over a month ago, but I am now getting to this because I couldn't type for a while.
172<>0<>And I got lazy.
173<>1<>Anyway- I really like the looks of the restaurant, dark, quiet, pretentious.
174<>1<>And I love being pretentious, it's so fun.
175<>1<>Between my friend and I, we had: braised oxtail and gnocchi lamb dark chocolate gelatto bottle of wine  We were also offered complimentary chickpea mix on crostini, various breads, and some cute and sweet nibbles at the end.
176<>1<>Also when I asked our server where the restrooms are, he actually showed me.
177<>1<>And the bathroom also passed my standards with flying colors.
178<>1<>They also had these super sonic hand dryer thing, which was just fascinating.
179<>1<>The food was great, wine was great, waiter and somelier were also both great and eager to help without being overbearing.
180<>1<>Looking forward to going back!
181<>1<>Always a great meal here!
182<>1<>Great service as well.
183<>1<>Seasonal rotating menu.
184<>1<>Everything is always made with fresh seasonal and regional ingredients.
185<>1<>Great wine list.
186<>1<>If you have the time do one of their seasonal tasting menus, which constantly change.
187<>1<>One is a pasta tasting menu and the other changes, this month it is a truffle tasting menu, the lady next to me at the bar had it and it looked really good.
188<>0<>I had housemade mortadella today and that was delish.
189<>1<>Chestnut and Mascarpone agnolotti was also amazing.
190<>1<>The octopus salad with spicy limocello vinaigrette is also another must.
191<>1<>If you can catch it this month, the mascarpone loose cheesecake with a sugar crust and cara cara oranges is to die for!
192<>1<>And the hazelnut and salted caramel gelato too!
193<>1<>Montenegro amaro is a must to end your meal.
194<>1<>Food was simply amazing; but then what else would one expect from Batalli and Bastianich?
195<>1<>Greeting and seating from the receptionist was less than desirable.
196<>1<>My wife and I were the only people in the restaurant and the next customer that came in was seated right next to us.
197<>0<>For the next hour or so we and the couple next to us were the only people in the restaurant which made it less than intimate and it was the intent as it was my wife's Birthday dinner.
198<>1<>We had ordered the pasta tasting menu which requires that the wait staff communicate with you regarding each course and each wine paring; unfortunately this was not as enjoyable with the table next to us watching and listening to every move.
199<>1<>They should consider this and seat the early diners with a little more distance; especially given the fact that there were two tasting menus offered.
200<>1<>Food was incredible as was the wait staff but then again it should be for a $500.00 dinner.
201<>0<>I always have a fatal attraction with a handsome stranger when I visit Vegas.
202<>0<>Our eyes meet from a distance.
203<>0<>Because I'm always a little too nervous to approach him, I wait for him to approach me.
204<>0<>Bold.
205<>0<>Clear amber hue.
206<>0<>A city boy with southern charm.
207<>0<>I'm intrigued.
208<>0<>Dapper.
209<>0<>He makes me feel like a classy lady.
210<>0<>Compliments me.
211<>0<>Has manners.
212<>0<>And when the attraction is too much to resist, my inhibitions go away and put him to my lips.
213<>0<>He tastes as smooth as he looks.
214<>0<>It's passionate, slow, and affectionate.
215<>0<>I take my time for I know our affair must be short-lived.
216<>0<>His tastes lingers long after our last touch.
217<>0<>I will miss him dearly.
218<>0<>I hope we meet again soon.
219<>0<>I write not of a new lover, but certainly of a new love.
220<>0<>I write about the best Makers Mark Manhattan I've ever tasted.
221<>0<>I even took a photo with my shitty iPhone camera to upload to my Facebook profile http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/DhSvFEjrk4JNbG_g3vDpag/l  Oh, the quail's pretty good too.
222<>1<>As expected, it was expensive.
223<>1<>Ive gone to churraacaria's before and this deserves half a star, their service was slow and  the sides were gross!
224<>1<>Even the rice was gross, really, how u mess up rice,  Im not sure,  pasta was tasteless, the mozzarella tasted weird, The olives were super salty, the only side I liked was the kale, so meat was so so, why did the pineapple and ham not come together?
225<>1<>I did not enjoy myself here and would not come back or refer my friends ro eat here.
226<>1<>Service is very very poor!
227<>1<>We were a party of 6 and gratuity of $40, for very poor slow service.
228<>1<>Took them 20 minutes to get us water and the manager, useless!
229<>1<>One of the staff said they were a little short staffed, but the manager just stood there and didnt even bother to help.
230<>1<>Nice job manager!
231<>1<>The best things I tried were the grilled chicken and the Brazilian fish stew.
232<>1<>I really don't think that the Bacon - wrapped filet mignon was really filet.
233<>1<>The food was ok overall, not great.
234<>1<>The problem was that the restaurant is not clean.
235<>1<>The booth bench seat was greasy and I refused to sit unless they cleaned it.
236<>1<>Instead the hostess sat us nearby and they never did clean it in the hour we were there.
237<>1<>The salad bar was also a complete mess.
238<>0<>Ah well.
239<>0<>Feeding the masses in Vegas I guess.
240<>0<>Would not return.
241<>1<>avoided a long wait by sitting at the bar but still received full rodizio service and lovely bar service.
242<>1<>Highly recommend the roasted chicken- cooked to absolute perfection.
243<>1<>Everything I had was delicious, especially the marinated olives, roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes, and the little cheese rolls from the buffet.
244<>1<>I was at Pampas for an event dinner while in Vegas for a conference.
245<>1<>This was a great place to hold a dinner for a large group (just over 100).
246<>1<>Our tea was never empty and the food was fantastic.
247<>1<>All the staff were efficient and courteous.
248<>1<>If you're in Vegas, give Pampas a try.
249<>1<>Awesome churrascaria - service was on point - server made sure that I tried everything!
250<>1<>For your money's worth and sheer quantity, you can't beat this place.
251<>1<>you get an unlimited salad bar + your lunch entree all for $10.
252<>1<>it is an unbeatable deal!
253<>1<>service was so-so, but for a hungry man on a budget, this place was a dream.
254<>1<>the other buffets cost $50-$75/person.
255<>1<>I ended up just eating from the salad bar and then taking my entree home for dinner!
256<>1<>that's dining on a budget in vegas.
257<>1<>They also have steak&eggs for breakfast, before 11am.
258<>0<>Not entirely sure why this is 3 stars.
259<>1<>I think it's delicious.
260<>1<>The meat rodizio is amazing.
261<>1<>Staff was kind and funny too.
262<>1<>Definitely coming back here when I go to Vegas again.
263<>0<>We came  for lunch.
264<>1<>Salad bar was good and the choices diverse enough.
265<>1<>The meat was o.k., but not outstanding.
266<>1<>Service was o.k., but not great.
267<>1<>Overall, I would probably go back for lunch, but I'm not sure if there is enough value for dinner, as the restaurant is a bit pricey for what they give you.
268<>1<>$5.99 breakfast steak and eggs...  Their version of steak is 4 thin slices of beef.
269<>1<>Best part is the potatoes.
270<>1<>Their french toast is not great.
271<>1<>Great price, but you get what you pay for.
272<>1<>Save money and don't be expecting anything tasty.
273<>0<>Oh my where to start!
274<>1<>I guess we should have heeded the warning signs: got stuck in traffic, couldn't locate it, was directed to a gentlemen wearing feathers and giving out discounted drink & dinner coupons, then as we were getting near the restaurant another gentlemen trying to convince us to "stop in & try us out".
275<>1<>We should have realized then they were trying too hard to get clientele into the restaurant.
276<>1<>However, putting that aside we were seated shortly after arriving... and waited.
277<>1<>Our server had a dismissive attitude and was more concerned about a dirty table needing to be cleared in his section than introducing himself and taking our order.
278<>1<>Then after having to repeat our drink order three times he still managed to bring the wrong drink ...not once but twice.
279<>1<>Thereafter he was pretty much absent from our table-- --however, very noticeably impatient with another couple as he kept looking at his watch as they tried to decide what they wanted.
280<>1<>Towards the end of the meal he did inquire if there was any item we'd like more of and I mentioned the tri-tip which never again came our way.
281<>1<>In spite of the service I was still hoping to have an enjoyable meal.
282<>0<>Not.
283<>1<>The food was way over-salted and the quality of meat was very disappointing.
284<>1<>We also had the option that included the seafood of which their "go to" flavor was obviously teriyaki - teriyaki  salmon, teriyaki mahi mahi...  and the shrimp was soft and soggy.
285<>1<>They also brought out crab cakes... deep fried, over charred pucks of shredded mystery seafood.
286<>1<>Needless to say I didn't even attempt to sample one.
287<>1<>Dessert was also included- we opted for the cheesecake however, between the odd tasting crust & the neon green gel-like stuff swirled on the plate after 2 bites my husband was "done".
288<>1<>To say we were disappointed is an understatement--and within 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant my stomach realized it needed to purge everything I had consumed.
289<>1<>So, we won't be returning ~even if it was offered to us free.
290<>0<>Enough said!
291<>1<>I'm a very picky eater but everything here looked amazing.
292<>1<>I ordered the California Club and it was great!
293<>1<>Once I was done I wanted to immediately go back.
294<>0<>Thank god for self control :)
295<>1<>This place is phenomenal!
296<>1<>The food is so fresh and tasty the guys that work there are truly very nice which is harder and harder to find these days.
297<>1<>I would definitely recommend this place to every.
298<>0<>Let me tell you a secret- AZ Burro.
299<>0<>This is the epitome of the PERFECT hungover breakfast spot in restaurant history.
300<>0<>When I lived in Scottsdale this was literally my favorite spot ever to go for breakfast.
301<>1<>My only complaint about here is that they don't serve alcohol, but let's be real nobody is perfect.
302<>0<>"AZ Burro" needs to be in the vocabulary of every person that likes to party in Scottsdale.
303<>0<>Why?
304<>0<>1.
305<>0<>It's pretty much the healthiest breakfast you can get without actually making it yourself 2.
306<>0<>It's perfectly filling after a long night out at smashboxx/hefe/etc that ended with a late night at pattie's 3.
307<>0<>It doesn't make you full to the point where you can't hit up RnR after to go day party and get started with some bottomless bloodys mimosas 4.
308<>0<>(and most importantly) D'lish is drive thru!
309<>0<>Making it ridiculously catered to the hungover person.
310<>0<>Don't want to see everyone you blacked out in front of last night or run into last night's hookup?
311<>0<>No problem.
312<>0<>Just make sure that you are sober enough to drive (aka no alc for you Arizona peeps) and drive on through that drive thru people!
313<>0<>I know, I know- it just sounds too good to be true but I promise I'm not making it up, this place really does exist.
314<>1<>Also the Breakfast Buzz is really filling but I would honestly recommend it as a meal in itself or like a snack or something because I don't know if you would be able to handle it with a meal unless you're really trying to get down then in that case go big or go home.
315<>1<>And at the end of the drive thru if you find that all this is just wayyy too healthy or you're over it, then Super Burrito is conveniently located next door.
316<>1<>Don't worry, they have a drive thru too so you can still avoid seeing anyone :)
317<>1<>Everytime I pull up to D'Lish I seriously have cartoon hearts popping out of my chest.
318<>1<>I have loved every single thing I've eaten here.
319<>1<>Breakfast go to is a Frittata - perfectly done.
320<>0<>Split a hummus if you're grabbing lunch with friends.
321<>1<>My new favorite dish is the Southwest Bowl - Basmati Rice and Enchilada Sauce together as one?
322<>0<>Yes, Please!
323<>1<>The staff here is phenomenal..always feel welcome!
324<>1<>I prefer to call ahead and you're in and out in a flash.
325<>1<>People are awesome so nice and the food is great!
326<>1<>I love the breakfast buzz and the California club!
327<>0<>!
328<>1<>I love Dlish, it is one of my favorite healthy spots to eat.
329<>1<>So grateful to have healthy and delicious restaurants like this, with also super amazing and friendly staff.
330<>1<>Thanks Dlish, and keep up the amazing work!!
331<>0<>!
332<>1<>D'Lish is DELISH!
333<>0<>I finally visited this darling establishment after reading my fellow Yelper's reviews, and I'm glad I did.
334<>1<>The guys that work here are super friendly and super cute ( that is soooo inappropriate for me to say at this age)  and they can make a very nice latte and wonderful food!
335<>1<>When you read that this is "fast food", don't be scared off that you are going to a chain-type establishment: this IS fast food that is freshly prepared and absolutely D'LISH!
336<>1<>I am absolutely obsessed with this place.
337<>1<>Every single thing about it is perfect.
338<>1<>The food.
339<>1<>The drinks.
340<>1<>The service.
341<>1<>The quaintness of the building.
342<>1<>I couldn't possibly explain in words how great I think this place is, but I will surely try.
343<>0<>The first time I ever went here was on New Year's Day and my friends and I still had on our Happy New Years dresses, heels, makeup, the whole 9-yards AND to top it off...we were sporting the hats that boasted HAPPY NEW YEAR all sparkly and obnoxious on it that we had somehow acquired the night before.
344<>0<>We were, needless to say, a bit hungover and ready for some delicious food after an incredible night.
345<>0<>The owners happened to be working that day and immediately jumped on board with us and joined us in shouting happy new year and then proceeded to explain the menu and take their time with us since we were clearly in no state to comprehend much of anything.
346<>1<>Needless to say, I fell in love with not only the owners but also the California Club (which we order on a croissant and add a hashbrown patty to).
347<>1<>This sandwich is like heaven, but better because it exists and is edible.
348<>1<>Seriously, if you're reading this, just stop and head over there for a California Club right now.
349<>0<>It'll be the best thing you have ever done with your life.
350<>1<>Ever since that day, I make special trips to this place (considering I live nearly an hour from it) and have never once been disappointed with the service or anything else.
351<>1<>This place can do no wrong and I just hope more people get the chance to try it because this is one place that should never go out of business.
352<>1<>I freaking love this place.
353<>1<>The food is always awesome, love the buzz, the staff is always hilarious.
354<>0<>They can blare all kinds of reggae music, hell even country ( and I hate country quite a bit) and I'd still be there pretty much everyday.
355<>1<>I do wish that they would be open later  so after work I could get dinner lol.
356<>1<>Great food and nice staff will return for sure when I get to town again
357<>1<>This restaurant came as a breath of fresh air after my last few disappointing outings as I explore my new town.
358<>1<>The menu offered creative, well-prepared, and beautifully presented fare.
359<>1<>The ambience was excellent.
360<>1<>Our waitress was friendly and our food was served promptly.
361<>1<>Highly recommend for a lunch or dinner with a friend, date, or on business.
362<>1<>One of the most pleasant experiences I've had in Phoenix since I moved here last month.
363<>1<>I wonder if I will be banned from heaven if I don't give this place at least 4 stars?
364<>0<>Oh well, I'm taking the risk.... Three stars - there you go.
365<>1<>I have been looking forward to trying St. Francis for many months and my experience was anticlimactic.
366<>1<>The interior architecture is as uninteresting as the exterior.
367<>0<>I'm not sure what saintly images I had conjured up, but I was imagining some sort of religious overtone.
368<>0<>Nope.
369<>1<>I was disappointed by lunch.
370<>1<>The menu isn't interesting nor diverse.
371<>1<>I ordered a onion burger and my friend orders a blah salad.
372<>1<>I hope to try it again for dinner - given all those 4 star reviews.
373<>1<>But honestly, after the lunch experience, I'm not in a rush to go back.
374<>0<>3.5.
375<>1<>Surprise complimentary valet for parking.
376<>1<>Good, solid, food in a cute atmosphere.
377<>1<>I enjoyed the live music and my baguette to take home.
378<>1<>The boyfriend thought the turkey scramble could be bigger and I would have more liked more evenly crispy fries but overall it was an enjoyable time and I would go back.
379<>0<>I visited St Francis the Sunday night the Cardinals beat the Packers right after the game (the valets actually told us of the win!)
380<>0<>and we got right in.
381<>1<>We sat at a table/booth in the back which allowed for plenty of people watching, which was great.
382<>1<>The decor is really modern and cool.
383<>1<>It isn't a huge space but it's comfy feeling.
384<>1<>I can't wait to come here when it warms up and the garage door front can be lifted.
385<>1<>We ordered a carafe of the house chardonnay and dinner, no apps.
386<>1<>The guys both got the burger, which looked amazing and was served with a bowl of nice crispy fries and some of the best ketchup I've had.
387<>1<>One person had the Arctic Chard salad and I had the roasted chicken.
388<>1<>The salad had a great flavor and so many veggies that I was sorry I didn't order it myself.
389<>1<>I personally didnt love the chicken, I'm not a dark meat fan and chicken skin kind of grosses me out.
390<>1<>but the green whipped potatoes were excellent- just wished there had been more of them!
391<>1<>Overall, I think its a great place,I just don't reccommend the chicken for wuss's like myself.
392<>1<>I came to St Francis to join friends for Happy Hour, as I am rarely in the area it was my first visit and I was instantly impressed with it's warm and intimate atmosphere.
393<>1<>Seating is available indoors or on the heated patio with additional seating upstairs.
394<>1<>Service was great and also accommodating in our request to stay warm but not too warm as we chose to dine outdoors braving a cool AZ evening.
395<>1<>It's great place to join friends, is family friendly(as they paid special attention to my daughter's cherry filled drink)and is a cozy enough location for a date.
396<>1<>I ordered the pork chili verde, topped with perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs, and a spicy roasted jalapeno, amazing!
397<>1<>Being with a friends whom generously shared, I was able to try a bite of the large tasty meatballs, and the pumpkin soup that was like eating a sweet whipped into perfection bite of dessert.
398<>1<>With such good food and service, St Francis is definitely worth  making a return visit!
399<>1<>The one reason I really really enjoy St. Francis is the atmosphere; the design is simply stunning.
400<>1<>The modern yet warmly welcoming space is high on my list of favorite designs in Phoenix.
401<>1<>Check it out, for sure.
402<>1<>The food, on the other hand, is only good.
403<>0<>I've had several of the entrees, and none of them were mind-blowing - the flavors were definitely on the subtle side.
404<>1<>I feel like the expectations set by the early buzz, the design of the space, and by the chef's name, set the bar a little too high.
405<>0<>I recently had the privilege of hearing Chef Aaron explain his thought process behind the restaurant; he felt that from the time it opened, he wanted it to be a great neighborhood restaurant where people from the community can gather for a family meal, meet up for happy hour, or just get together for no particular reason at all.
406<>1<>This is a nice vision, and I won't claim that there isn't room for this concept in the area, but I think his prices are a little high, and the menu a little too limited (at least so far) to really fill that niche.
407<>1<>Action plan for the future: lower prices and expand the menu, or experiment a little, bring the excellence we all believe you're capable of to the table.
408<>1<>I've never had any complaints with the service, the parking...  All problem-free, if not excellent.
409<>1<>And I'll continue to visit St. Francis, I just don't see it as deserving of 5 stars at this juncture.
410<>1<>I do wanna try out this brunch business I've heard about...
411<>0<>I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks.
412<>1<>Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open.
413<>0<>It was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday.
414<>0<>I parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant.
415<>1<>I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.
416<>1<>The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive.
417<>1<>He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex.
418<>1<>He was just a peach!
419<>1<>The unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine.
420<>0<>There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory!
421<>1<>Structurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used.
422<>1<>Icky.
423<>1<>Once the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned.
424<>0<>They got slammed.
425<>1<>Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs.
426<>1<>The food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections.
427<>1<>They fell flat.
428<>1<>I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site.
429<>1<>The olives were plentiful and tasty.
430<>1<>The bread however was burnt.
431<>1<>It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight.
432<>1<>Our cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back.
433<>1<>The reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes.
434<>1<>But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint.
435<>0<>Now I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies.
436<>1<>The need to "accommodate" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars.
437<>1<>When I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks.
438<>1<>But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine.
439<>1<>it took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.
440<>1<>On my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets.
441<>1<>One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered.
442<>0<>I rolled down my window, and said "You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, " I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation.
443<>0<>"Most people know."
444<>0<>he replied.
445<>0<>"Know what?"
446<>0<>I asked.
447<>0<>"To let us know."
448<>0<>Confused, I wasnt sure what he meant.
449<>1<>My passenger said "You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out."
450<>0<>The attendant responded, "Look lady, that's the name of the game."
451<>0<>My passenger said "What game is that?"
452<>1<>He replied sarcastically, "Well if you've ever been to St. Francis..." "I have not" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out.
453<>1<>1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.
454<>1<>2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY!
455<>0<>To which i replied "I have not been here before and I wont be back now" to which he replied "Well good " and rolled his eyes.
456<>1<>St Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant.
457<>1<>And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in.
458<>1<>Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!
459<>1<>Long wait.
460<>1<>Over priced.
461<>1<>Under served.
462<>1<>So many better places to go.
463<>1<>Words cannot express how awesome this place is.
464<>1<>The happy hour prices are phenomenal!!!!
465<>1<>Food is fresh and the servers are extremely knowledgeable about the menu!!!!
466<>1<>Always good food and good service!!!
467<>0<>!
468<>1<>So after trying a few more things I've come to the conclusion that this is a nice swanky place to dine at for atmosphere, not so much for food.
469<>1<>I tried the meatball dish from their happy hour menu.
470<>1<>I think its cumin, but one of the flavors is just overpowering.
471<>1<>The bread it comes with is rock hard, not sure if you're supposed to soak it in something?
472<>1<>It  was a bit overkilled..
473<>1<>The flatbread pizza was good.
474<>1<>The cheesecake in the jar was not very good - more like cheesecake pudding in a jar..
475<>1<>The sticky toffee pudding wasn't bad but could've used something nutty or salty...  something.
476<>1<>Brunch was terrible.
477<>1<>I had the Eggs Benedict with prosciutto.
478<>1<>The hollandaise sauce was barely holding the emulsion when I got it and didn't taste like much of anything.
479<>1<>The dish overall was bland and could have used some freshness - asparagus, parsley?
480<>1<>It was just heavy and blah.
481<>1<>The biscuit and gravy dish was a disappointment as well.
482<>1<>The biscuits were not fully done in the middle.
483<>1<>The sausage was actually good, but they were too stingy with it which resulted in another bland and heavy dish.
484<>1<>My wife and I just had dinner at Sushi Roku, and we really enjoyed it.
485<>1<>The service was terrific, especially our server, Deborah.
486<>1<>The ingredients were fresh, the warm dishes were straight from the kitchen, and the portions were adequate.
487<>1<>Highlights included the Lobster Tempura with a Miso Glaze and the Kobe Beef Pot Stickers.
488<>1<>The sushi was terrific, too.
489<>1<>We had plenty to eat, and two cocktails each, for about $150, plus tip.would dine here again, for sure.
490<>0<>I don't know much about sushi other than I have never had something like this before.
491<>1<>It was simply amazing so much flavor.
492<>0<>The interior and view compliment such good food.
493<>0<>Wow....where do I start.
494<>0<>We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style.
495<>0<>I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku.
496<>0<>I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about.
497<>0<>Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even "better" treatment.
498<>1<>We showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party.
499<>1<>We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful.
500<>1<>The "waitress" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order.
501<>1<>My first thought was "wow she is so not personable".
502<>0<>It proceeded to go down from there.
503<>1<>The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table.
504<>1<>She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables.
505<>1<>Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said "yes".
506<>1<>At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group.
507<>1<>Needless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members.
508<>1<>I would never go back there based on my experience.
509<>1<>If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday.
510<>1<>We consistently have great service, food and quality every time we visit.
511<>1<>We have dinner here at the very least twice a year during our Vegas trips and recommend our sushi loving friends to head over there too when they are in Vegas.
512<>1<>I am sure there are other places to go for sushi in Vegas but the location (in Caesar's Forum Shops and there is valet, right off of Las Vegas Blvd., so no mixing with all the other LVB traffic, cabs and hoypoloy!)
513<>1<>Our latest visit was much of the same, great service, sushi and quality.
514<>1<>They had a private event that took up most of the dining room, but opened up more seating and were able to seat our party of 4, maybe 15 minutes later but it was prime time dinner hour 7:30 pm and there is a Peter Lik gallery across the way so the wait was nominal.
515<>1<>We ordered our staple crab miso, rolls and sushi.
516<>1<>The wait staff was attentive and quick to fill waters, change plates and check on us.
517<>1<>We had a great meal!
518<>1<>food: got the worst food poisoning after eating at sushi roku in vegas.
519<>1<>worst.
520<>1<>service: bad  final thoughts: awful
521<>1<>Ehhhhh.... its okay.
522<>0<>Gots to give it to them for the decor and ambience they've got going on.
523<>1<>The service was fabulous and they checked on us, refilled our drinks and what not.
524<>1<>I had a bento box with spicy tuna sushi rolls and the food for some reason tasted mediocre to me.
525<>1<>But what really impress me about this joint is that the decor was very nice, but I hate it when I go to a restaurant where the food isn't up to par with the restaurant though.
526<>1<>I like the factor that they used real bamboo as their coverings in the window as tourists would walk by, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and somber like.
527<>1<>I wouldn't mind coming back here, but I just think that you could've found a better place compare to here.
528<>1<>Its just overrated.
529<>1<>Made a reservation the day of without any problems.
530<>1<>Had to wait just a few minutes, but gave us some time to get some drinks, which were quite good.
531<>1<>Food-wise, we split the kobe beef cooked on a hot stone and then shared a bunch of rolls as well as some sake.
532<>1<>No complaints from anybody about the food, but the only issue we had was our i'm-better-than-you waiter who served us.
533<>1<>Definitely talked down to us and tried to make us order the more expensive sake, the more expensive rolls, and another appetizer of the already expensive kobe beef.
534<>1<>But even the annoying waiter couldn't keep us from enjoying our food and the restaurant.
535<>1<>For the four of us that ate there, the bill came to about $250.
536<>0<>Luckily we were there for work, so it wasn't actually our money we were spending.
537<>1<>Might not have enjoyed the place as much otherwise.
538<>0<>The table next to us had a man in his late-60s or early 70s flanked by two busty girls in their late-20s or early-30s.
539<>0<>We tried to figure that relationship out.
540<>0<>Ah, Vegas.
541<>1<>Pretty average sushi nothing too special.
542<>1<>The restaurant was pretty empty on Wednesday night.
543<>1<>We ordered multiple roles the best role what's a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each roll.
544<>1<>I've had a lot better sushi at better prices but I guess this is what you can expect in Vegas.
545<>1<>At least I can say the fish tasted fresh
546<>1<>OMG hands down BEST sushi EVER!!!!
547<>1<>We go on average 2 times a month and OMG it is so so fantastic!!!
548<>1<>We try other sushi restaurants and always come back to Roku!
549<>1<>Does not get any better than this.....There is no better sushi in all of Vegas and Henderson!
550<>1<>trust me we have tried MANY!!!
551<>1<>MUST GET the baked crab roll :)
552<>1<>my friends thought it was amazing, but i'm asian so my standards are a little higher.
553<>1<>taste wise, i've definately had better at numerous other places.
554<>1<>but the ambiance is what you pay for.
555<>1<>deep, dark and moody just how i like it.
556<>1<>umm....the sea bass was very good, but if i wanted high quality, fresh sashimi, i'd probably go somewhere else cuz last time i checked, fried rice was chinese.
557<>1<>service was great though.
558<>0<>OK,  I have eaten at Joe's several times in Miami and Phyllis who lived most of her life in Miami was a regular.
559<>1<>She dragged me to Joe's in Vegas as a non negotiable demand!
560<>1<>It was very disappointing.
561<>1<>It lacked the ambiance of old school elegance that Joe's portrays in Miami, the decor was similar but the service was not.
562<>1<>Although good the Vegas servers did not carry off the spirit of "old school" as expected.
563<>1<>The worse part was the stone crabs, why we where there.
564<>1<>They where not great.
565<>1<>Not really bad but not up to the Joe's name.
566<>1<>All in all the meal and experience where not worth it.
567<>1<>If you are a Joe's Miami fan you will not be happy.
568<>1<>Finally this is not a value for the money and it is not hard to do much better in Vegas.
569<>1<>Excellent service, great food, Alaskan King crab legs were huge and pre-cut lighting at our table made reading the menu difficult but excellent overall experience
570<>1<>I wanted to bring my boyfriend to a nice dinner for his birthday - he of course wanted to go back to Mastro's but I told him we had to try somewhere new.
571<>0<>After leaving Joe's the was happy with this choice and that's all I can ask for since it was his birthday and I wanted to make sure it was special.
572<>1<>I on the other hand left unsatisfied but it was my own fault because I didn't order what I actually wanted for my entree.
573<>1<>We decided to opt out of getting an appetizer because we never finish our entrees and my main plan was to get the stone crab appetizer and scallops as my entree but because we decided on no appetizer I got the medium stone crab as my entree.
574<>0<>Every review talks about the stone crab so I figured we couldn't miss out on trying it.
575<>1<>They were really good, the meat was sweet but I do recommend only getting them as an appetizer unless you want a cold entree.
576<>0<>My boyfriend of course got the filet mignon and lobster and the filet was cooked perfect and as well as the lobster.
577<>0<>And luckily he is a generous person and let me take a few bites of his plate since he could tell I wasn't so happy with mine.
578<>1<>The service was great - once we walked in and gave our names the host right away turned to Cam and wished him a Happy Birthday.
579<>1<>We had reservations so we were seated quickly.
580<>1<>Drinks were never empty and our table was cleaned before they brought out the birthday cake (that is a huge pet peeve of mine - don't bring out the cake until our table is cleaned off.
581<>1<>Nothing like a bunch of dirty empty dishes on the table as we sing happy birthday!
582<>0<>Maybe I'm weird but it does bother me.)
583<>1<>A table for 9 please.....I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and we were seated promptly when everyone showed up.
584<>0<>It was my aunt's bday and since I'm a "foodie" I picked Joe's.
585<>0<>After I made my first appearance here on New Years, I hoped this place would meet the same expectations.
586<>1<>Unfortunately it didn't.....  Food: 4.25 Stars Service: 2.5 Stars Overall: 3.75 Stars  Yes, we started off with 14 "select" stone crabs!
587<>0<>14 of them!!!!
588<>1<>(120 dollars worth of stone crabs).
589<>1<>This was delicious like I remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that I could dip anything in it!
590<>1<>We also tried the Rockefeller Oyster which I was not that impressed.
591<>0<>I didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....
592<>1<>I ordered the Bone In Ribeye this time and I shared it with my dad.
593<>0<>I had it cooked Medium.
594<>1<>Well, last time I had gotten the filet mignon and let's just say I was a bit disappointed with the steak.
595<>1<>It was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all.
596<>0<>Luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor.
597<>1<>However, I was a really REALLY disappointed about my steak.
598<>1<>The Jennie's mashed potatoes made up for it though as well as the garlic Spinach.
599<>0<>I didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!
600<>1<>My other foodmates ordered the fried chicken (heard it wasn't as awesome as KFC's chicken, but he is a teenager), sea bass (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my Aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized).
601<>1<>Overall, I think the food was enjoyable, minus my dry steak.
602<>1<>Now the service....I understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically.
603<>0<>Since its a "nicer" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service.
604<>1<>Maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars I think we deserve some good attention.
605<>1<>It's not that we were getting HORRIBLE service, we just were neglected.
606<>1<>I watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there.
607<>0<>After my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away.
608<>1<>In MY opinion, I think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab?
609<>1<>Maybe I'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean I don't love Joe's...I just would ask for a different server.
610<>1<>Overall, the Havana Dream Pie is to die for and I love their stone crabs.
611<>1<>Next time I will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.
612<>0<>Every time I come to LV I make sure to drop in to Joes.
613<>1<>How can I explain how I love me some Joes?
614<>1<>Joes is consistent, fresh, yummy, excellent, fulfilling, and fast....(i could go on longer but I'll refrain) I do not like crab.
615<>1<>Ugh crab is just so foul, so what do you order when the place is known for crab... salmon!
616<>1<>oh my goodness, I love love their salmon.
617<>1<>Then again I love all salmon but there is spectacular.
618<>1<>Do NOT get it with their buttery sauce, it is perfect with just a hint of lemon.
619<>0<>Mmmmm.
620<>1<>My father likes to try other things so I would nibble off his plate since I cannot stray from the salmon.
621<>1<>I've had their steak, I don't know which kind but wow.
622<>0<>For a seafood place they can make a steak.
623<>1<>Let me explain: My dad likes to get steak cooked black and blue, literally only warm on the inside, disgusting, and when I still had a bite I was in love.
624<>1<>I didn't feel that I was just eating a lab of undercooked meat, I was gourmet-ing.
625<>1<>THe ambiance is nice, the food is awesome, the service is sufficient, the key lime pie is fantastic.
626<>1<>Joes is the place to go.
627<>0<>But don't just take my word for it, try it yourself
628<>1<>One of the top places to eat!
629<>0<>I've been to Cut and other super expensive steakhouses.
630<>0<>I've had steaks that are $100 + (steak should never be that much).
631<>0<>When the steakhouse is that expensive, everything else is pricy too.
632<>0<>The total cost of one meal would be close to $150 per person at those places.
633<>0<>The quality is also good but nothing spectacular.
634<>1<>Joe's steaks, filet mignon, lamb chops, glazed cod, etc.
635<>1<>are all excellent!
636<>1<>The prices are reasonable.
637<>1<>The sides are great.
638<>1<>The stone crabs are delicious as well.
639<>1<>The atmosphere is nice too.
640<>1<>For a lighter meal, try their salads ----soooo good.
641<>1<>To sum it up...  Everything at Joe's is quality and delicious.
642<>1<>You can try a bunch of entrees (steak, crab, lamb, cod) and sides (lobster bisque, salads, cream corn, jeanies potatoes) with a party of 5 and only pay $50 per person.
643<>0<>The other high end food places will cost you $150 but you only get a small cut of steak and 1 side.
644<>1<>Joe's still my favorite in Vegas
645<>0<>I was looking for a great steak place that wouldn't break the bank for my friends and I.
646<>0<>The reviews were pretty good so we decided to give it a shot!
647<>1<>I was very happy that we chose Joe's!
648<>1<>The sevice was excellent!
649<>1<>My husband and I split the ribeye and we had the crab legs (only happens 4 weeks out of the year so why not?!).
650<>1<>The ribeye was good, but it wasn't the best.
651<>1<>The crab legs were by far the best I've ever had in my life.
652<>1<>AMAZING!
653<>1<>Sides were good too.
654<>1<>We had the mac & cheese (was just the right amount of creamy- I find restaurants make it too dry for my tastes, but I love it!
655<>1<>), mashed potatoes (YUM), and the brussels (eh).
656<>1<>All in all, I was VERY pleased with my experience.
657<>1<>Wouldn't say it was the best, but would say it was pretty darned good.
658<>1<>Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/9.
659<>1<>A--MAZ--ING!!!
660<>1<>You must get the Stone Crabs (large ones if they have them) They are Melt in your Mouth.
661<>1<>They give you a Mustard/Mayo Dipping sauce which my Mom said was incredible but I dont like Mayo.
662<>1<>So they gave me a Malt Vinegar and their Red Wine Shallot vinigerette to dip the crabs in,  Both were sooo good!
663<>1<>We started with salads.
664<>1<>I had the Chopped Veggie Salad which had a ton of veggies and was great.
665<>0<>My parents had a Chopped Lettuce Tomato and Blue Cheese Salad which they loved.
666<>0<>My Dad did not get the Stone Crabs, he got Lobster Tail  Tempura.
667<>1<>I tasted it, and it was also Melt in Your Mouth.
668<>1<>Sides we got: Lyonaisse Potatoes (I dont eat potatoes but they looked amazing if you do).
669<>0<>They were  dome shape, crunchy, and had carmelized onions on top.
670<>1<>Brocollini, which was simple with a garlic and olive oil, but very good.
671<>1<>They give you a good selection of breads beforehand that seem to be homemade.
672<>1<>I'm not really one to eat bread before a meal, but they had these really think cracker like things with parm cheese baked in and some intersesting seeds that we couldnt get enough of.
673<>0<>Parents split the Key Lime Pie for dessert.
674<>0<>I didnt eat it, but it looked good, they said it was very good and the homemade crust looked good.
675<>1<>Waiter was great.
676<>0<>Very informative and nice.
677<>1<>I'd 100% recommend.
678<>1<>One of those places that, yes its pricey, but the food makes it totally worth the money.
679<>1<>Short story the food is almost good and they give you a very good bread basket.
680<>1<>Long story.
681<>1<>You have to order seafood or beef here that is what they do.
682<>1<>My husband ordered the rib eye sandwich and I ordered the maui maui lunch plate.
683<>1<>My waitress suggest that I order a side dish because she thought it wouldn't be enough food so I ordered the heirloom tomatoes.
684<>1<>Someone soon brings out a bread basket, I do have to say that it was a very good above average bread basket with yummy pretzel bread, a cheese and onion roll and other breads.
685<>1<>We received the tomatoes and I do note that the tomatoes were stunning great tomatoes but I hated the vinaigrette because it had chunks of gelatin in it and I thought that was gross.
686<>0<>My husband didn't mind the chunks of gelatin so some people might like it that way.
687<>1<>I was able to eat the tomatoes if I scraped the gelatin chunks off.
688<>0<>We receive the meals and my husband said the rib eye was pretty good but had a lot of butter poured on it.
689<>1<>My maui maui was nice and fresh but was DROWNING in butter.
690<>1<>The jicama slaw that came with my meal was almost good but I couldn't eat it after I tasted it because it was totally oil saturated.
691<>1<>If you like LOTS of BUTTER or OIL with your food and a great bread basket EAT AT JOE'S!
692<>1<>Joe's is high-quality well-prepared food, excellent service, and an old-time steakhouse atmosphere.
693<>1<>We went for my husband's birthday and had a great time.
694<>1<>Obviously their signature stone crab claws are excellent.
695<>1<>For our entrees, I had the glazed black cod, based on the recommendation of other reviewers.
696<>1<>I was not disappointed - it was excellent!
697<>1<>Light, flaky, but with a little bit of sweet barbecued glaze.
698<>0<>My husband had the steak and king crab, which was also very good.
699<>1<>I might complain about the amount of king crab (it seemed like less than one leg), but we were so stuffed, we didn't even finish everything anyway.
700<>1<>Our sides were the corn and creamed spinach.
701<>1<>I would not normally have ordered corn, but this was quite good, and I loved the creamed spinach.
702<>1<>He drank, I had club soda, and we shared a dessert.
703<>1<>Total, with tip, was just over $150 - you could pay a lot more for a lot worse food!
704<>1<>FUN FUN FUN place!
705<>1<>Great vibe, service, fantastic views (ya gotta hit that bathroom, ladies!
706<>1<>spectaculah!).
707<>1<>You'll love it!
708<>1<>This review is for the lounge.
709<>1<>MIX is located on the 64th floor of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay.
710<>0<>I've visited the lounge twice now (one time they wanted $20 cover, which I would definitely not pay to come to this place).
711<>1<>The experience begins with a quick elevator ride up tot he top of the tower.
712<>1<>The glass elevator is open to the outside, so you can get a nice view of the strip on the way up.
713<>1<>The biggest highlight of MIX is definitely the view.
714<>1<>There is an outdoor patio area with lounge chairs and such to soak it all in.
715<>1<>Even the bathroom urinals offer a nice view of Mandalay Bay's pool complex.
716<>1<>The drinks weren't as imaginative as the Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan, and were a bit on the pricey side, but the view and ambiance is nice, which is basically why you would come here in the first place.
717<>0<>I.
718<>0<>Have.
719<>0<>Amazing.
720<>0<>Friends.
721<>1<>Last November for my big 30th birthday I and several of my close friends came to Vegas to celebrate.
722<>0<>They surprised me with a birthday dinner reservation at the well known Mix.
723<>1<>This restaurant is located at the top of the THEhotel (on the 64th floor!!!!)
724<>1<>adjoining Mandalay Bay.
725<>1<>What this means is that the view is OUTSTANDING because it faces the entire strip.
726<>1<>Outstanding or maybe breathtaking?
727<>0<>Hard to say which one.
728<>1<>This restaurant is truly stunning.
729<>1<>Example:  your view of the strip is a complete 360 thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows, which are everywhere including the bathroom.
730<>1<>Make sure you visit the bathroom!
731<>1<>Let's start with the 24 foot chandelier that has literally 15,000 hand blown glass spheres.
732<>1<>Beautiful.
733<>1<>The entire interior is chic modern, and almost glows like the sheen you see on bubbles.
734<>1<>Attached to the restaurant is the lounge, which has an open deck facing the strip where you can get the best views.
735<>1<>Next, the food:  exquisite.
736<>1<>World famous French chef Alain Ducasse is at the helm at Mix and he does not disappoint.
737<>1<>Most everything here is French based, and our table partook in all the high points of the menu from the soups to the steaks to the foie gras.
738<>1<>(And for the record yes I felt guilty eating foie gras).
739<>1<>There is nothing on this menu that you could order and not love.
740<>1<>Mix was kind enough to let my friends bring over a birthday cake from Freed's bakery and they cut up the cake and served it for us.
741<>1<>Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable.
742<>1<>This is a must place to eat and see the views when in Vegas.
743<>1<>We had a reservation at the restaurant but instead of any great view we were given a seat in a weird white bubble facing nothing except other diners.
744<>1<>It was really an awful place to sit.
745<>1<>Our waiter explained how right now they had a special menu for the chef which owns the restaurant (Alain Ducasse) and that we should order from that since it was "better".
746<>1<>We ordered a few dishes: Shrimp Cocktail appetizer - It was good, made us feel a little excited about the dinner.
747<>1<>Ironically it was the best dish and the only one we got not on the Alain Ducasse menu.
748<>1<>Boneless Ribeye - It was not good.
749<>1<>I felt like I paid $46 for a USDA select cut of meat.
750<>1<>It wasn't tender and the fat wasn't juicy.
751<>0<>I cook better steaks on a stove-top at home.
752<>1<>John Dory "Meuniere" - The fish was dry, overcooked, and way underseasoned.
753<>1<>This dish was only 1/2 eaten.
754<>1<>We didn't even order dessert since our main courses were so poor.
755<>1<>Somehow those 3 dishes totaled up to $140 even w/o drinks.
756<>1<>I think the waiter realized we weren't very happy, and brought us a little baked good with some nutella.
757<>1<>That was ok but we were happy to get out of there.
758<>1<>We were only in town for 2 days so it was extremely disappointing.
759<>0<>Me: Hey babe, guess where we are going tonight?
760<>0<>Her: Where?
761<>0<>me: Mix.
762<>0<>Her: Date night, say whaaaaaat?!?
763<>0<>Boom, instant brownie points.
764<>0<>We both have mutual friends that swear by this place, and for good reason.
765<>1<>The food was delicious and *cliche description everybody gives* the view was amazing.
766<>1<>The service wasn't anything too bad, but I did notice that it took a while for our food to arrive.
767<>0<>Luckily, I enjoyed the conversation I was having with my lady.
768<>1<>My only real turn off at miX is how close the tables are to each other.
769<>1<>There is so much space in the restaurant not being used, why cram everybody in together?
770<>1<>miX gets 4 stars.
771<>1<>As for the guy at the table to my right that I was forced to have dinner with, I wish I could find his yelp page and give him 1 star for the irritatingly loud ringtone of a cricket that he seemed not to hear every 2 minutes.
772<>0<>This review is strictly on the Lounge, not the restaurant (they should probably be categorized separately): This place is a mystery to me.
773<>0<>It has a phenomenal view of the strip and a cool vibe inside yet every time I am there its pretty empty.
774<>1<>Maybe I am going on the wrong nights, maybe at the wrong times, but for as many times as I have gone up there I find it hard to understand how it's always so empty.
775<>0<>The view is everything for me.
776<>1<>It brings MiX from an average lounge to a 4 star lounge.
777<>0<>It could use some T.L.C.
778<>0<>and I'm not talking about the R&B group ("creep" is their best song by the way).
779<>1<>It needs a refresh inside and I wish the patio was a bit wider.
780<>1<>It's a shame to have that beautiful view and such a small patio (advantage Foundation Room).
781<>1<>The decor and furniture is modern and fun but could also be updated a bit.
782<>1<>The black paint inside could definitely be updated and changed to something more friendly and appealing.
783<>1<>They have a relatively small dance floor but it is encased by floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip so I would say that makes up for it.
784<>0<>I don't really know what else to say here.
785<>1<>I never really stay very long when I go to MiX.
786<>1<>It's usually just drop in for a drink and take in the view to show some friends in town and then go on to another place.
787<>1<>I had a hard time giving them 4 stars but I feel that 3 is too low.
788<>1<>It's a shame because it has 5 star potential.
789<>1<>I really hope that they invest some money into improving or re-branding MiX.
790<>1<>Aesthetically pleasing dining room.
791<>1<>Felt like a restaurant I would see in Miami .
792<>1<>I love the seating in the pods.
793<>1<>Good food , good service .
794<>1<>Thank you Sebastian for taking care of us.
795<>1<>I love this place.
796<>1<>The view from the 64th floor and the ability to sit and drink on the balcony makes this my favorite lounge in Vegas so far.
797<>1<>What was really special, were the ladies bathrooms.
798<>1<>The stalls are individual rooms that have a glass wall.
799<>1<>So yup, you can squat while looking out at Vegas from 64 stories up.
800<>1<>It's pretty mesmerizing.
801<>0<>We didn't eat here, but were here for a private party.
802<>1<>It was an open bar and all of the drinks were made perfectly.
803<>1<>The DJ was pretty weak, and we weren't the only ones who thought so.
804<>0<>When we did end up leaving, we walked into the elevator followed by a group of guys who were thinking the same thing out loud.
805<>1<>Not many peppy "OMG THIS IS MY SONGGGGGG" moments going on here.
806<>1<>I'd love to eat here or drink here again.
807<>1<>The outdoor lounge has them ost fantastic views and the couch seats are incredibly comfortable, you could easily sit here all night.
808<>0<>This review is only for the lounge and not the restaurant.
809<>0<>We stumbled upon this hidden lounge after coming out of the Michael Jackson show, loved it!
810<>1<>We were initially thought it would be a little too pretentious, but we were so wrong.
811<>1<>The servers, bouncer and bartenders were all nice... either that or we were just too intoxicated to notice.
812<>1<>The view is beautiful.
813<>0<>The crowd tends to be on the older side of 30.
814<>1<>Loved that the bartender was giving us girls double shots!
815<>1<>Even the bathroom has a view...
816<>1<>A chilly dining experience that detracts from excellent food.
817<>1<>Walking into Mix after a VIP elevator ride to the 64th floor lets you know right off the bat what you're in for--a restaurant that prides itself on impressing with the appearance of eliteness.
818<>1<>You walk through the dark black and red lounge into the uber-modern, all white, all open dining space littered with tables.
819<>1<>Beautiful, yes, but a place you can settle in for a relaxing, private meal?
820<>0<>Definitely not.
821<>1<>Las Vegas is all about spectacle, and Mix definitely has that.
822<>1<>But everything from the doorstop of a wine menu to the 18 different servers who hover over you as you eat discourages complete enjoyment.
823<>0<>You're so busy trying not to look un-chic that you forget to have fun.
824<>1<>And the food--excellent, no question.
825<>1<>I had the curried lobster and my fella had the bison tenderloin.
826<>1<>The portions were small but impeccably cooked and flavored.
827<>1<>The bison was so tender, it made me angry at every other steak I'd ever had.
828<>1<>The prices are quite high, even for Vegas.
829<>1<>The cocktail list is all sweet, flavored vodka drinks--they want you to drink wine anyway.
830<>1<>Bottom line--great food overwhelmed by a snooty vibe and personality-less service.
831<>0<>During our last trip to vegas, we had the pleasure of having a meal at this pub.
832<>1<>Of course, its Vegas, so it's only slightly more authentic than the rest of Vegas, but as a restaurant it's quite nice.
833<>1<>In fact, this was actually a return trip to this pub.
834<>1<>Both times that we've been, the host/wait staff has been friendly, helpful an ready to serve.
835<>1<>This time, was sat in a small demi-room with a couch-booth.
836<>1<>It made me happy and the delicious Magner's cider (so much better from the tap than from a bottle) kept me nice and comfy in my seat.
837<>1<>Plus, we were seated upstairs, where the bar is, so the noise of the casino was blotted out entirely.
838<>1<>Both times I've eaten here, I've been happy.
839<>1<>The waitress recommended the horseradish crusted halibut, which was worth the recommendation.
840<>0<>My husband had the chicken pot pie, which was full-flavored and rich.
841<>1<>Since he's british and a pickey eater to boot, this is a good sign.
842<>1<>In short, I can't speak to its authenticity, but the food, atmosphere and beer are worth a stop.
843<>0<>There should be a distinction on here that says if you are rating based on the food, or the drinks and atmosphere.
844<>0<>I am rating based on the food since we came here for dinner and not the live music and nightlife.
845<>1<>I did not think 9 Fine was all it is cracked up to be if you want to grab a bite somewhere.
846<>0<>There are lots of other places on the strip to go to.
847<>1<>I had the lamb stew which was good but not worth the price.
848<>0<>My husband had the bangers and mash which was good but very salty, and he really did not like the cabbage.
849<>0<>Our companion had the shepherd's pie which was pretty standard.
850<>1<>The soda bread at the beginning of the meal was lacking in flavor.
851<>1<>I am glad we tried 9 Fine but don't quite get the hype.
852<>0<>Everyone told me Vegas has great food.
853<>1<>On a recent trip I did not experience anything close to great until our stumble into Nine Fine Irishmen.
854<>1<>Literally felt like I stepped into a slice of Ireland.
855<>1<>this place felt so cozy, i wanted to sit and stay awhile.
856<>1<>Service was superb the entire time, our waitress was a doll.
857<>1<>Started off with an appetizer of the Beer n' cheese dip.
858<>1<>Assorted breads complete with a cheese dip infused with Smithwick's Irish Ale.
859<>1<>One of the best cheese dips I have ever had, I could have had this as my meal (with all the carbs I inhaled, I probably should have) OH well, when in Vegas!
860<>1<>:)  For lunch I got the Corned Beef Sandwich.
861<>1<>Corned beef was chopped up in bit sized pieces making this the easiest corned beef sandwich to eat.
862<>1<>Corned beef was piled high and falling out the sides, i had the bacon mayo topped this baby and it was a big hot delicious mess that I enjoyed every second of.
863<>1<>I could not move mind you after this entire experience, but ohhh it was so worth it.
864<>1<>Next time I am in Vegas, this will surely be on my to do list again.
865<>1<>DELICIOUS!
866<>1<>Nine Fine was one of the best meals I have ever had!
867<>1<>I had the filet and shrimp and it was delicious!
868<>1<>They also have live music at night which I didn't get to see but if the atmosphere is as amazing as dinner I will definitely be back.
869<>1<>Traditional Irish pub with the great selection on tap and outside seating with view of the strip.
870<>1<>Great environment, draft and bartenders
871<>1<>Nine Fine Irishmen is one of my favorite restaurants/pubs in Las Vegas!
872<>1<>If there is somewhere I could go everyday of my life, it would be this pub.
873<>1<>I cannot say enough incredible things about this restaurant to do it justice.
874<>0<>My boyfriend and I have been here several times, the first time being one year before we moved to Vegas from Chicago.
875<>0<>Coming from a city filled to the brim with Irish Pubs (our favorite is Celtic Crossing downtown), we searched high and low for a great pub to relax and have some Guinness.
876<>1<>Nine Fine Irishmen was perfect on many different levels.
877<>0<>1.
878<>1<>They have a gluten-free menu.
879<>1<>I'm not talking about a junk gluten-free menu that has you substitute or remove certain parts of a dish and are flavorless yet expensive.
880<>1<>This gluten-free menu IS THE BEST!
881<>1<>Sheperd's Pie?
882<>1<>Gluten-free.
883<>1<>Seafood Chowder (another soup that finds its way into my food dreams at night)?
884<>1<>Gluten-free.
885<>1<>AMAZING SALMON SALAD - GLUTEN-FREE!
886<>1<>The brie-stuffed chicken?
887<>1<>Gluten-Free!
888<>1<>JOY!
889<>0<>2.
890<>1<>Live Irish Music.
891<>0<>Need I say anything more?
892<>1<>Good quality, authentic, Irish music including dancers and sometimes bagpipes.
893<>1<>You can NEVER complain about this music, and it provides a nice background while sitting out on the patio watching the crowds go by.
894<>0<>3.
895<>1<>Whiskey and Beer.
896<>1<>Guinness on-tap AT THE TABLE.
897<>1<>No further description necessary.
898<>0<>4.
899<>1<>Service: Fantastic.
900<>0<>Every single time.
901<>1<>Friendly, informative and always attentive, even when they're busy at night.
902<>1<>I've never had anything less than great service at NFI.
903<>0<>5.
904<>1<>The BEST Jameson Martini I have ever had in my life.
905<>0<>My boyfriend's family is Scottish (amongst other things), so the man loves his whiskey.
906<>1<>When you take Jameson (one of my favorites), add some apple juice, a little pucker and one other ingredient, you get the ultimate mantini in martini form!
907<>1<>You can be the most masculine man and still enjoy this FANTASTIC concotion without feeling even a bit feminine.
908<>0<>Bottom line?
909<>1<>Go there.
910<>0<>Now.
911<>0<>Immediately.
912<>1<>Do not pass go, just get a martini, sit on the patio listening to the live music and get fat and happy.
913<>0<>Nine Fine Irishmen is located inside of the New York New York Hotel.
914<>1<>It's a nice, two-story Irish bar that serves all of the best whiskeys.
915<>1<>They also have a pretty good selection of other alcohol.
916<>0<>I came for an event and we were placed on the second floor.
917<>1<>They have a large bar on the top floor and that night they were featuring three whiskeys.
918<>0<>I can only remember two of them, but those two were Jameson and Bushmills.
919<>1<>Both were great, but I think I'm just more used to drinking Jameson.
920<>1<>They also had a large cheese platter and dessert platter.
921<>1<>They had about 4 cheese to choose from and a couple sides that go along with the cheese.
922<>1<>I really liked the one that was a mix of huge garlic, herbs, and oil.
923<>1<>They also had several different types of grilled vegetables.
924<>1<>They had about 8 different types of dessert and I was determined to try every single one.
925<>1<>All of the desserts were small in size.
926<>1<>I would say a couple bites worth each.
927<>1<>Since I came for an event I'm not really sure if all the appetizers and desserts are on the regular menu, but I had a great time here and I would definitely visit again when I come with friends.
928<>1<>Good for a Guinness and a couple of apps.
929<>1<>We were there for Happy Hour, and the price was right for a break from the New York New York gaming floor.
930<>0<>We didn't get further than the bar area, so this review has nothing to do with the rest of the restaurant.
931<>1<>The potatoes with 2 curry dipping sauces were delicious!
932<>1<>A nice New York-style Irish Pub.
933<>1<>It has all the authenticity of your typical American Irish Pub, so little nooks to sit in, decent selection of beer, and "Irish" music.
934<>1<>We had lunch here, the food was ok to good but the service was mixed.
935<>1<>Our group ordered a variety of dishes and no one complained but no one raved either.
936<>1<>Our waitress managed to mix up drink orders, our bill and confuse a dessert with a pint of Guinness; and seemed to disappear after we asked for the bill.
937<>1<>But we were seated right quick and she would appear to refill drinks and check on us at good intervals.
938<>1<>If you want a place to sit down and eat, and not feel rushed to get back on the gaming floor, this'll do.
939<>1<>I think the food was good and the service was better than good.
940<>1<>I think my review comes down to how messy the food is and much you have to work to get to it.
941<>1<>I will prob try this place again but I am not sure if it is really that special.
942<>1<>If you love seafood and working to eat it than this might just be your place.
943<>1<>If you are not a big seafood fan than I think you might think about this place the same as I did.
944<>1<>I had crawfish, shrimp and crab.
945<>1<>I enjoyed two out of the three, though there was a lot of work getting the crawfish and the crab as to be expexted I guess.
946<>1<>I enjoyed the shrimp most which I ordered medium with sausage, corn and potatoes.
947<>0<>If I come back here again this is what I will be ordering.
948<>1<>Overall for me just an ok place to eat.
949<>1<>Prob a little over hyped.
950<>1<>My husband and I love this place!!!!
951<>1<>We got the crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes in the Hot and Juicy seasoning/ medium heat.
952<>1<>YUM!
953<>1<>We did smell like garlic for the next couple days, but it was totally worth it.
954<>1<>As some one else said, the corn did seem a little over cooked, but it wasn't bad enough to stop me from going and getting it again.
955<>0<>I know people say there are better places in CA, but I don't happen to live in CA, so will probably not get a chance to try other places anytime soon.
956<>1<>I love being able to support a local restaurant that is privately owned- well done Hot N Juicy Crawfish!
957<>0<>I wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so I decided to treat her and her fiance to some Hot and Juicy Crawfish.
958<>0<>I grew up in so cal where Boiling Crab reigns supreme, and after moving to Vegas I've had an empty void that needed filling.
959<>1<>I saw the Man vs Food episode and I've read the reviews before stepping in, So I came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.
960<>0<>Between the 3 of us this is what we ordered.
961<>1<>dozen raw oysters, catfish basket, 2# shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy.
962<>1<>The only complaint about the service was that our raw oysters, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.
963<>1<>Raw Oysters- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.
964<>1<>I'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.
965<>1<>Oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.
966<>1<>Catfish basket- breaded in a cornmeal crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.
967<>1<>Personally I'm not a big fan of cornmeal breading, but I can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.
968<>1<>Catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the "Southern" flavor.
969<>1<>I actually enjoyed this the most.
970<>1<>Shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy-  We ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.
971<>1<>the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well.
972<>1<>the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.
973<>1<>the "hot n juicy special" sauce isn't as flavorful as I expected, and the "very spicy" here is comparable to  "medium spicy" at Boiling Crab.
974<>1<>But the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were "okay".
975<>1<>Not the freshest shrimp I've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert?
976<>1<>Crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy-  I'm debating whether or not I should even review this item just because I should have known better than to order this when I already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.
977<>1<>Needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.
978<>1<>So I'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.
979<>1<>Perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.
980<>0<>Maybe I'm being a bit unfair because I'm comparing this establishment to Boiling Crab.
981<>1<>However the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in Vegas.
982<>1<>If I was asked to come here again, I would, but I don't see myself CRAVING Hot and Juicy Crawfish like I do for Boiling Crab.
983<>1<>I guess my best advice is if you're a Boiling Crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.
984<>1<>if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert.
985<>1<>Love!
986<>0<>Just discovered them this year.
987<>1<>I always get a lb.
988<>1<>of shrimp, less than mild, because i'm a spice wuss.
989<>0<>Actually, too much spice makes me sick, so I avoid it.
990<>0<>But, even "less than mild" has a little kick to it and doesn't affect me so, perfect!
991<>1<>I usually order corn and sausage, with the shrimp, then a side of rice or sweet potato fries.
992<>1<>Every time I'm in Vegas I try to drop by.
993<>1<>I look forward to it every time now.
994<>1<>Great place.
995<>1<>Not a long wait at all, and the waitresses are super friendly.
996<>0<>==================================================  Updated again:    They were actually closed, this time, due to health violations in 2010...info from the Las Vegas Review Journal "Restaurant Report": http://www.lvrj.com/taste/restaurant-report-105329198.html  Personally I could care less if a restaurant get's downgraded due to violations because they often are just a bunch of minor things but I am strict, personally, about seafood restaurants.
997<>0<>I've eaten at B and C retaurants before...not often..but I have and it was no big deal.
998<>1<>But yeah...actually being shut down?
999<>0<>Nah.
1000<>1<>Not for me, because it's seafood.
1001<>0<>It's up to YOU to make that decision.
1002<>1<>Most of you may not care, but people like me would want to know if they're going to chow down on shrimp and crawdads.
1003<>0<>You would be surprised how many seafood places get downgraded but I don't often read about closures.
1004<>0<>Anyways...if you want to still eat here I have an idea that may solve things.
1005<>0<>Watch the restaurant reports and go after the reinspections because they would have fixed all of the problems.
1006<>1<>I think that's the best one can do with these cases, if you want to eat there but you're still worried.
1007<>1<>==================================================  Original update:  I loved the food when I ate there but it's kinda ruined it for ME, because of an old news alert put on Channel 13 action news back in 2009.
1008<>0<>I just discovered this today as I was researching the art festival First Friday.
1009<>0<>I was conflicted about  updating my rating, because it's such old news, but I knew I would have wanted to know anyways, if I were perusing Yelp, so that others could make an informed decision of their own.
1010<>1<>I downgraded my rating to A-OK, which is 3 stars.
1011<>1<>It's not bad, it's not good.
1012<>1<>I'm more interested in being neutral about this place and letting you decide for yourself.
1013<>0<>I had my bad experience in July.
1014<>0<>The owner addressed the problems in August, to my satisfaction.
1015<>1<>Then in November they got a C rating with the Health Department.
1016<>1<>If you google the Vegas channel 13 news website for their segment called "Dirty Dining", you will find they had run an article on Hot N Juicy  Crawfish about many health district violations from about the time I wrote my reviews.
1017<>0<>The News channel aquired the records of the health inspection which were archived as PUBLIC records.
1018<>0<>They publish them as a community service.
1019<>0<>-----------  I think it's commendable he fixed the problems listed on the report.
1020<>0<>Just like he fixed the problems I experienced when I had a bad time there.
1021<>0<>I admit I'm a little freaked out these problems were there when I was eating there but oh well.
1022<>0<>I never got sick!
1023<>1<>So the final verdict is this:  1) The food tasted great!
1024<>1<>2) They've kept their A rating since the 1 time downgrade to C in Nov 2009 by the health department.
1025<>1<>That's GOOD!
1026<>1<>They're most likely safe to eat at and you'll have a wonderful time!
1027<>1<>It's never happened again, and I believe people and habits can change.
1028<>1<>3) After reading their reviews, service still seems to be inconsistent, as the norm.
1029<>1<>It's just my PERSONAL decision to not eat there any more because I can't get their past violations out of my head after reading the report, but that's just ME.
1030<>0<>I'm on the lookout for a new place to try when I have cravings for messy seafood.
1031<>0<>Any suggestions?
1032<>0<>Ah, Vegas.
1033<>1<>So yeah, I dined at the supremely elegant Fleur de Lys, downed steak at the trendy N9NE Steakhouse, and ate my frites at Bouchon - but nothing was quite as satisfying as rolling up my sleeves, donning a bib, and digging into a bag full of hot and juicy crawfish.
1034<>1<>After watching the Man vs. Food Vegas edition, we decided the trek off the strip was worth it for pounds upon pounds of seafood, all seasoned with the house signature, Hot and Juicy sauce.
1035<>1<>This is interactive dining, not for the faint-hearted.
1036<>1<>We ordered several pounds of Hot and Juicy crawfish, Hot and Juicy shrimp, king crab legs, chicken nuggets, corn& potatoes and cajun fries.
1037<>1<>While extremely inexpensive and delicious, be prepared to get down and dirty.
1038<>1<>If you can dig your beer under the mounds of crawfish and shrimp shells, take a long swig because even the mild sauce had my senses in a frenzy.
1039<>0<>Ask for extra paper towels.
1040<>1<>3% off your bill if you opt to pay in cash.
1041<>1<>The wait can be long but at $3 a beer, the time will pass quickly.
1042<>0<>Okay, this review may be a little biased because I'm comparing my Hot and Juicy experience with Boiling Crab out in California, but really...
1043<>0<>Hot and Juicy?
1044<>1<>NOT SO HOT AND JUICY!
1045<>0<>My friend recommended this place because her cousin saw it on the Food Network.
1046<>1<>I want to go to Food Network, tell them that they SUCK, that they should retract the special on Hot and Juicy, and that they should do a special on Boiling Crab instead.
1047<>0<>Okay, maybe not as harsh.
1048<>1<>- We all ordered the shrimp with the Medium Hot and Juicy Special sauce.
1049<>1<>At BC, you can see the garlic, pepper, and the deep red sauce in the bag.
1050<>1<>Also,  the Medium Whole Shabang has a spicy taste that lingers.
1051<>1<>This is what I was expecting.
1052<>1<>Instead, the shrimp at H&J came out super bland, not spicy, and not juicy at all.
1053<>1<>I had to squish my shrimp around the barely-there sauce to get it to have any flavor at all.
1054<>0<>- We had to ask for limes, salt, and pepper.
1055<>1<>They took forever to get the limes out to us.
1056<>1<>It was as if they went to go buy limes and cut them up just for us.
1057<>0<>- You can't draw on the walls.
1058<>0<>How wack is that?
1059<>0<>Haha.
1060<>1<>The staff was friendly and the venue was clean, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.
1061<>0<>I'm sorry H&J...  2 stars for you cuz: "Meh.
1062<>1<>I've definitely experienced better."
1063<>1<>Pretty good but felt like crawfish was lacking something.
1064<>1<>Maybe lack sweetness in the meat or not alot of meat.
1065<>0<>I dont know what though... good if youve never tried it.
1066<>1<>I really like Hot and Juicy.
1067<>1<>It's delicious, requires about a million napkins, hands on eating.
1068<>1<>Great to mow down, drink a couple beers and enjoy potato and corn dipped in the crawfish juice glory.
1069<>1<>Foods great!
1070<>1<>Not salty at all and very flavorful!
1071<>1<>I enjoyed the environment here and the service was great.
1072<>1<>The food was juicy and the shrimp were huge!
1073<>0<>I remember seeing this on Man v. Food and passed by it a few times when we were in Vegas, but never really thought I'd stop by and eat.
1074<>0<>Since a friend of ours recommended it to us we decided to give it a try.
1075<>1<>No wait to be seated.
1076<>1<>Server kept coming by to check to see if we were ok even though it was getting busy...
1077<>1<>I'd give this place 5 stars.
1078<>1<>Great visit...
1079<>1<>Great burgers and dogs, grilled thin crust pizza, sandwiches and more.
1080<>1<>You can't beat some of the unique twists that Joe's puts on common fare.
1081<>0<>Especially when they are using their own farm fresh produce.
1082<>1<>Casual and comfortable atmosphere as well.
1083<>0<>Full review and more pictures: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/2011/03/02/joes-farm-grill/
1084<>0<>Darn it!
1085<>1<>Chris B. took all my good points, including the bathroom (with a TV that was running an episode of the delightfully retro "Supermarionation" show called "Thunderbirds.")
1086<>1<>The condiment fountain is, indeed, a miracle of fast-food engineering.
1087<>1<>And the food was fantastic.
1088<>1<>The BF and I waaaay overate, but it was worth every tasty bite of the ahi sandwich with Asian slaw, seafood combo plate, chocolate malt, and chocolate-coconut bars.
1089<>1<>We'll be return customers, no doubt.
1090<>1<>My only complaint was that the bun with the ahi sandwich was a little too sweet for my taste; it detracted slightly from the Asian flavors.
1091<>1<>As for other reviewers who complained about flies....yes, there were some, outside, around the tables on the grass.
1092<>1<>When you eat al fresco, that's the chance you take.
1093<>1<>You're next to a working farm (hence, the name) in an area still somewhat agrarian; what do you expect?
1094<>1<>Inside, and at the non-grass outdoor table, it wasn't a problem.
1095<>1<>The service was fine; tables and the self-service area were being kept clean, in spite of the lunch crowd.
1096<>1<>My only suggestion is that another bay of drink dispensers would come in handy when the joint is jumpin'.
1097<>1<>Lousy service, food is ok IF they have what you want.
1098<>0<>I showed up today, wooed to go here by the description of the Ham & Cheese fritters.
1099<>1<>So, arriving 10 minutes after they opened at 8 - they were out.
1100<>0<>No "sorry" - just "we don't have it, but it's on the list to be made."
1101<>0<>Good to know.
1102<>1<>Maybe one of the two cooks on break or the cook who kept running back and forth to the bathroom texting on could have made some.
1103<>1<>I got something else (only because the counter girl made me feel uncomfortable, becuase I was taking too long thinking about a plan B) - it was ok.  Service was mediocre - counter girl just set on our empty drink cups on the counter, forcing us to reach inside their stupid window while she watched.
1104<>0<>The maintenance guy (after a good 30 minute BS session with another maintenance guy) proceeded to stink up the outside (how hard is to stink up the outside?)
1105<>1<>using ridiculous amounts of stainless steel polish.
1106<>0<>I was visiting friends, who said they don't go becuase it is always crowded.
1107<>1<>Every time we drove by this week, the parking lot was empty.
1108<>1<>10 minutes after open - you are already out of stuff for the after-church breakfast crowd - now I see why.
1109<>1<>Most TV stars make it becuase they are great actors - this TV star acts like a great restaurant - but really - I would pass.
1110<>0<>Stick to farming, Joe.
1111<>0<>EDIT - I was contacted by their General Manager within hours of this review being posted.
1112<>1<>That is some quick response, and he seemed genuine in making things right.
1113<>1<>It does not change what the visit was like, but I will give them another star for the effort to fix things so quickly.
1114<>1<>There's a reason this place appeared on Guy Fieri's show: it's awesome.
1115<>0<>I wound up in this part of Gilbert for something else and stopped here to eat.
1116<>1<>And I did not regret it.
1117<>1<>I had the Fontina Burger (no field greens) and onion rings.
1118<>1<>The onion rings were very good if a touch over breaded, and the burger was dynamite.
1119<>1<>Mushrooms, cheese, beef, red pepper, etc.?
1120<>0<>Sign me up!
1121<>1<>Plus they had great shakes and a nice atmosphere.
1122<>1<>Another "blast-off" place on the level of Pita Jungle.
1123<>1<>Tip: it's not crowded at 4pm on a Friday, but it does get busier soon after.
1124<>1<>This is one of my husband's favorite restaurants and we love that we can eat outdoors here.
1125<>1<>The menu has a lot of great food and the quantities are large, so often my husband and I will split one thing and get either onion rings or the garlic fries.
1126<>1<>We love their BBQ Chicken Pizza, too.
1127<>1<>Any of their burgers and salads that we've tried are good.
1128<>1<>So yummy.
1129<>1<>And, they are always so friendly.
1130<>1<>That is why there is often a long line to get into the place.
1131<>1<>Even though, the line does move quickly.
1132<>1<>This is a great place for the family to eat and for dates with my husband with the kids.
1133<>1<>The food is delicious.
1134<>1<>The ribs are cooked differently than Joe's Real BBQ, but they are delicious nonetheless.
1135<>1<>The atmosphere, surroundings of Joe's is also very comforting and peaceful.
1136<>1<>We love Joe's Farm Grill.
1137<>0<>And it's not too far from where we live either!
1138<>1<>I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.
1139<>1<>Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive...
1140<>1<>I loved everything about my visit to Joe's Farm Grill!
1141<>1<>I ordered the Fontina Burger.
1142<>1<>It was lovely and fresh.
1143<>1<>The food is made with quality ingredients in a casual atmosphere.
1144<>0<>We sat at the picnic tables under the trees with fragrant orange blossoms.
1145<>0<>The weather was gorgeous and it felt so relaxing and calming.
1146<>0<>I loved the change of pace and scenery.
1147<>0<>We did not want to leave.
1148<>1<>Went back here again on 8/13 and yep...still great.
1149<>1<>I've been here a few times, and everything I've ordered has been delicious!
1150<>0<>I've been to Joe's Farm Grill many times.
1151<>0<>Usually, it's when I'm in the area showing homes to clients.
1152<>0<>It's always been a big hit with my clients who see it as a great change from the usual fast food restaurants their children want to eat at for lunch.
1153<>0<>Joe's has some delicious food items for adults and children alike.
1154<>1<>They have plenty of comfortable seating inside, or if you'd prefer, you can eat outside under a big tree.
1155<>0<>I just don't recommend the outside seating when it's 112 degrees here in the valley.
1156<>0<>Before you leave, and even if you don't have to, check out the bathrooms.
1157<>1<>There are old claymation movies playing in there which is very nostalgic.
1158<>1<>Plus the bathrooms are clean!
1159<>0<>Go Joe's.
1160<>1<>Stripburger is in a very nice area of the strip and you can easily walk to if you are at the mall.
1161<>1<>I love the fact that there was outdoor seating and the scenery was not so bad either.
1162<>1<>I did not have  the pleasure of eating one of their infamous burgers, but I did try out the chili cheese fries.
1163<>1<>I was not very fond of them because the chili was a bit bland and watery.
1164<>1<>The sour cream and the Ketchup were lifesavers for this appetizer.
1165<>1<>As in the past I walked away form Stripburger happy with the experience.
1166<>1<>I ordered the three cheese burger along with the spicy atomic cheese fries.
1167<>1<>The burger was cooked  medium as ordered.
1168<>1<>That is so rare.
1169<>0<>Most places ask, but no matter what you request it comes out well.
1170<>1<>The burger was tasty and juicy.
1171<>1<>The fries were great.
1172<>1<>You get an ample portion.
1173<>1<>There is plenty of cheese and jalapenos on them.
1174<>0<>I also ordered Jeff's Shakin Lemonade.
1175<>0<>I generally stay away from these specialty type cocktails, but this lemonade is good.
1176<>1<>With this place you get good food, at a good price with a great view of the strip.
1177<>0<>I used Priceline so am staying at the Trump Hotel, and this place was the closest within walking distance to grab something for dinner.
1178<>0<>Unfortunately, I probably won't be going back.
1179<>1<>I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey burger with pepper jack and a small salad to go - easy enough, right?
1180<>1<>First they brought out a to-go bag with only the salad... the barback went back and 5 min later brought out a turkey burger.
1181<>0<>I asked if it was turkey w/pepper jack and he said he didn't know so asked the barternder.
1182<>0<>She said yes.
1183<>0<>?
1184<>1<>Then there wasn't silverware or condiments in the bag, so the barback had to go back and retreive those as well.
1185<>0<>So, when I got back to the hotel to eat/work, there was no pepper jack.
1186<>0<>I paid for cheese, certainly WAITED for cheese, but did I get cheese?
1187<>1<>No, I got a mediocre burger so over-seasoned with pepper it was almost inedible.
1188<>0<>(and I LOVE pepper, btw!)
1189<>1<>Annoying I didn't get what I ordered.
1190<>1<>The most delicious hamburger not just on the Strip,but  ANYWHERE!!!
1191<>0<>We had a to go order that was piping hot when we picked it up.
1192<>1<>BUT the fries were even good hours later--COLD.. lol.. Love the new milkshakes Mango Coconut and Peanut Butter... We had an appetizer in El Segundo the Mex place next door.
1193<>1<>The server Jose E.. Just ask for the Jose with 6 or 7 kids...is awesome...
1194<>0<>I met my boyfriends daughters for the first time.
1195<>1<>I was quite nervous but he made us all relax.
1196<>1<>They are very kid friendly which is almost impossible to find on the Strip..
1197<>0<>Strip isnt exactly Disney Land..
1198<>1<>So check out for a relaxed,fun,kid friendly place...take out or dine in...
1199<>0<>Came upon this place as we were walking the strip.
1200<>1<>Burgers, shakes and cakes sounded pretty good, but what brought us in was the open setup and the beer on tap.
1201<>1<>If felt like someone had brought the beach to Vegas.
1202<>1<>Neat outdoor scene with views of the strip and really, really good food.
1203<>1<>The bartender recommended both the Blue Cheese burger and the sweet potato fires, neither of which I would have ordered on my own.
1204<>1<>Good to take a rec now and again, as these were both stomach achingly delicious.
1205<>1<>Great food, service, views and even relatively cheap for Vegas.
1206<>1<>I will definitely be back my next time through.
1207<>1<>First of all, the location of the restaurant is at the north tip of the Fashion Show Mall.
1208<>0<>What exactly is the Fashion Show Mall?
1209<>0<>It is a bunch of chain stores and tacky shops thrown together in a flying saucer looking building.
1210<>0<>Nothing about the place says Fashion, Show, or Mall.
1211<>0<>But anyway...Stripburger.
1212<>0<>Right across from Wynn...or Encore...whichever one that is.
1213<>1<>Sit outside and you can see Trump Casino in the distance.
1214<>1<>Horrible service but the food was decent.
1215<>1<>It is relatively cheap.
1216<>1<>Good news is usually the service is so horrific that you will not feel bad about not leaving a tip.
1217<>1<>So...cheap food and no tip should be in your budget.
1218<>1<>Here is a tip though...it is not a good place to get drunk because it is at a major intersection.
1219<>1<>If you get hit there will be nothing but a blood and margarita mixed smear on the ground with an imprint of Penn & Teller advertising.
1220<>1<>I love this place!
1221<>1<>We signed up for their diner card and they don't send you excessive emails, instead I get a text message for free fries/onion rings about once a month.
1222<>0<>I also got a $15 gift certificate for my birthday.
1223<>1<>I highly recommend getting one.
1224<>1<>Our bartender, Amy, is awesome.
1225<>0<>I feel like everyone we go we see her.
1226<>1<>She tells us about upcoming specials and even though she is always swamped with serving people, she is freaking fast!
1227<>1<>I'm never waiting for a refill and our food order is always right.
1228<>1<>I just love the outdoor environment and great service from both Amy and the food staff.
1229<>0<>What?!
1230<>0<>Happy hour EVERYDAY from 4-7pm?!
1231<>0<>Yes.
1232<>1<>$2 on selected draft beers and $4 margaritas.
1233<>0<>Skip the margaritas and do the beer!
1234<>1<>I had the Hickory burger and it was great.
1235<>1<>It was cooked to order the way I wanted it, and with the condiments that I selected.
1236<>1<>It was just the right size too.
1237<>1<>Not quite as big as a burger from Island, and not as tiny as one from In N Out either.
1238<>1<>Also, I order a side of fries -- half sweet potato fries and half garlic and herb.
1239<>1<>I asked for a side of the chef's special dippin' sauce with them on the side too.
1240<>1<>The atomic fries, which are topped with cheddar cheese and sliced jalapenos are great too.
1241<>1<>Just ask and you can mix what variety of fries you'd like.
1242<>1<>Good food, drinks, good location to people watch on the strip!
1243<>0<>We spent a week in Vegas and ate at at least 10 burger places during that time.
1244<>1<>This was the BEST one we found overall.
1245<>1<>The portions are large, everything was made perfectly, our waitress was great, the drinks were excellent, good people watching and best of all, its not over priced.
1246<>1<>I didn't think we would find a reasonably priced place on the strip, but here it is.
1247<>0<>Hidden in a corner.
1248<>1<>We will definitely be coming back during our next trip
1249<>0<>Located outside the front of the Fashion Show Mall, the entire restaurant is outside.
1250<>1<>It is a great place to do some people-watching.
1251<>1<>$10 burgers does not include fries.
1252<>1<>Limited selection on the menu.
1253<>1<>The burgers are excellent.
1254<>1<>The shakes are very good but pricey.
1255<>1<>We also had the cheddar fries, which were very good, too.
1256<>1<>This is your typical "fancy" burger joint.
1257<>1<>Or at least a joint that tries to be fancy.
1258<>1<>This is basically just a sports bar that serves burgers with French names so they can charge more.
1259<>1<>I did like their selection of burgers (salmon, chicken, veggie, turkey and beef).
1260<>1<>Both my wife and I ordered the "Le Paris" burger that had brie, smoked bacon and caramelized onions.
1261<>1<>I ordered the beef burger and she ordered the chicken one.
1262<>1<>We also ordered the fry sampler with waffle and petite fries.
1263<>1<>The burgers were pretty tasty and a good size.
1264<>1<>My only complaint was that the meat was VERY VERY salty.
1265<>1<>Both the beef and chicken were seasoned with something with tons of salt.
1266<>1<>The waffle fries were ok but the other ones were just 'eh.
1267<>0<>They needed some kind of aioli.
1268<>1<>Our waitress was fast and friendly and the bill was not too unreasonable because it is over-priced Vegas after all.
1269<>1<>With tons of other burger joints in Vegas I probably will not return to this one.
1270<>0<>Ah, the vegas burger wars are now officially out of control with the opening of "Burger Joint" at Flamingo.
1271<>1<>What's sad is, that our grandkids probably won't even appreciate or respect the burger wars of Las Vegas.
1272<>0<>Oh the Zumanity!
1273<>1<>The burger here is filled with a montreol like steak seasoning and might really appeal to some, but it was just okay to me.
1274<>1<>The beef is Angus, but I can't remember if they reference a grade of beef.
1275<>1<>For the burger hardcore, the grind was medium.
1276<>1<>The fries were very good.
1277<>1<>Beer and Softdrinks reasonably priced.
1278<>1<>Tasted the shake, which was nothing special.
1279<>0<>Here are my top 5 Vegas Burger Choices  5.
1280<>0<>Le Burger Brasserie 4.
1281<>0<>BLT Burger at Mirage 3.
1282<>0<>TheBurger at TheCafe (yes, its in TheHotel, which is in TheLobby) 2.
1283<>0<>Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay (which is actually at Mandalay Place) 1.
1284<>0<>Bobby Flay Burger Caesars Palace.
1285<>1<>The food here was really great.
1286<>1<>I recommend the Nutella milkshake.
1287<>1<>My husband and I both love it.
1288<>1<>I had Le Paris burger and he had the Mediterranean.
1289<>1<>I enjoyed his more than mine.
1290<>1<>Just be aware fries do not come with the order, you pay for those separate.
1291<>1<>The waitress could have been more friendly.
1292<>1<>It took her ten minutes just to come over and tell us she be with us in a bit.
1293<>1<>Restaurant wasn't even full.
1294<>1<>The only time she came over was to take our order, bring our food and then bring out check.
1295<>1<>No drink refills, no asking if we needed anything else.
1296<>1<>When she brought back the check she said have a good day with her back turned towards us walking away.
1297<>1<>Milkshake was AWESOME!
1298<>1<>I got the Espresso Milkshake and it came in a big glass with a mountain of whip cream.
1299<>0<>Enough for more than 2 people to share.
1300<>1<>I also had the Le Italian burger (arugala, mozzerella, and pancetta) and waffle fries which were good...but the milkshake was the best thing there.
1301<>1<>Service was a little slow...or maybe we were just anxious to gamble.
1302<>1<>Prices are "reasonable" Vegas prices, just win your money back after the lunch.
1303<>1<>Good place to stop for a casual (non-buffet) meal in Vegas.
1304<>0<>My and wife and I are vegetarians, which makes for difficult eating on the Strip.
1305<>1<>Le Burger attracted us with the veg burger menu.
1306<>1<>We liked the selection process; bun type, toppings, etc.
1307<>1<>However, we were disappointed when the burgers arrived.
1308<>1<>They were remarkably greasy.
1309<>1<>The patties almost seemed deep-fried and the buns were oily.
1310<>0<>My wife ate 1/4 of her burger and I about 1/2 of mine.
1311<>0<>We rushed over to the gelato kiosk to rid our mouths of the greasy aftertaste.
1312<>1<>Beers were good and the staff friendly.
1313<>1<>Shame about the food quality.
1314<>1<>Lots of choices for toppings.
1315<>1<>$10 burgers does not include fries ...
1316<>1<>However there are 3 styles for fries: thin cut, thick cut and waffle.
1317<>1<>Mostly just burgers and (ground) chicken sandwiches.
1318<>0<>We go every time we are in Vegas.
1319<>1<>It is located in the indoor passage between the Bally's and Paris casinos (near the big slots at Bally's).
1320<>0<>Its called a sports bar and does have allot of tv's, they just seem a tad small.
1321<>1<>This place is located right a the entrance from Paris to Harrahs.
1322<>1<>Stopped in for some drinks and a chicken caesars  salad.
1323<>1<>The salad was very large and tasted good, the chicken was really good.
1324<>1<>Bonus they had a 5-7pm happy hour going on 2 for 1 drinks.
1325<>1<>Cool place to hang out, escape the casino and watch tv.
1326<>1<>I will try and stop by this place again.
1327<>1<>For the price and atmosphere, everything was just about what it should have been.
1328<>1<>The burgers were well cooked, not anything special, but very tasty none the less.
1329<>1<>We ordered the potato skins appetizer and that was very good also.
1330<>1<>But the best part of the meal honestly were the shakes!
1331<>1<>They were very tasty and smooth!
1332<>1<>Service was good, not great, but certainly not terrible.
1333<>1<>Its not a place to take little kids.
1334<>1<>Its more of a sports bar/restaurant.
1335<>1<>The prices are decent for the quality of food that is offered.
1336<>1<>I had a groupon and went to use it and they said Sorry its not valid on Sundays.
1337<>1<>Say what.. Well in tiny print it says it on the groupon but they honored it anyways.
1338<>1<>It is very loud in here and its a place to drink and eat burgers and watch sports.
1339<>1<>It is dark inside too, not good for people who have a vision problem.
1340<>1<>4 stars because they honored the groupon, the food was good quality.
1341<>0<>I didnt go here for the atmosphere with my 4 kids, I went bc I had a groupon.
1342<>0<>First off, I only review burgers.
1343<>0<>Heard from my friend Yohan that this place had a pretty dang good burger so I went to verify with my non-burger loving mother again.
1344<>1<>She ended up getting a salad this time and seemed to enjoy it.
1345<>1<>My burger was pretty plain.
1346<>0<>No frills.
1347<>0<>That being said, the patty was seasoned enough so that it didn't need a lot of help in the condiments department.
1348<>0<>That being said, while it was good, I don't think I would crave it unless I already happened to be in the Paris hotel and casino.
1349<>1<>WHAT I ORDERED:   Le POULET (salad) - 3/5 pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular  Le CLASSIQUE (burger) - 3/5 solid patty, adding a special sauce might push it to 4/5  Sweet Potato Fries - 4/5 how can you go wrong with these?
1350<>1<>STAFF: Exceptional.
1351<>1<>Our waitress was attentive and genuinely sweet.
1352<>1<>WAIT TIME: No wait time Saturday around 6:30pm  PORTION:  Hearty sized burger.
1353<>1<>BANG FOR YOUR BUCK  The portions and quality of burger match the price well.
1354<>1<>WOULD I RETURN  Probably not
1355<>1<>Love this restaurant!
1356<>1<>Awesome vibe, good energy, wonderful waiters/waitresses.
1357<>1<>Came here for prom a few years back and remembered loving it.
1358<>0<>That's why I came back for my 20th birthday dinner here with a group of 15 friends.
1359<>1<>Our waiter was super friendly and attentive.
1360<>1<>Had something simple like chicken fingers as an appetizer, shared the steak special (honestly I've had better elsewhere) but I won't complain it is what it is.
1361<>1<>Had the birthday dessert Pazookie and loved it as well as everyone else who took a bite!
1362<>1<>Only other thing I might add is that it was really hot inside.
1363<>1<>We told our waiter about it and he kindly told us that he agreed and alerted the manager.
1364<>1<>Also, they give a discount when you check in on yelp, which was pretty cool too.
1365<>1<>I recommend Switch :)
1366<>0<>Ok, I'm torn.
1367<>1<>I dig this the atmosphere, with its trendy vibe and blue lights and the super rad lamp at the end of the bar.
1368<>1<>The drinks are very tasty, and happy hour lasts until 6:30.
1369<>1<>I usually get the red sangria or one of their drunken Italian sodas (Italian soda with vodka, yes!!
1370<>1<>)...I plan on ordering the Blackberry Kir Royal next time, however, cause it sounds fancy and yummy.
1371<>1<>I took myself on a brunch date here once and ordered a mimosa for 3 bucks, and when it came out is was an entire carafe...for THREE DOLLARS!
1372<>1<>My challenge to this place is for them to kick it up a bit as far as the food goes.
1373<>1<>I mean, it's not bad...but when I think to myself "Self, where would you like to grab a bite to eat?"
1374<>1<>this place isn't on the top of my list.
1375<>1<>I want food that makes me salivate when I think about it.
1376<>0<>I want a place that calls to me from afar, tempting me to rush back in.
1377<>1<>The service is usually pretty good, especially when Chrissy is serving it up.
1378<>1<>As far as vegan fare, they had an amazing vegan chili for the month of January...but if they wanted, I would totally be ok with them putting it on the menu for realsies.
1379<>1<>I am able to veganize a fair amount if their food (pitas and salads), and they have a black bean soy burger that can be made vegan if you get it without the bun and aioli.
1380<>1<>All in all, we will definitely be back, as we like to support local and lgbtq businesses.
1381<>1<>:)
1382<>0<>It's hard to believe it's been almost four years since I wrote my first review of Switch.
1383<>1<>Since then, I've probably been to Switch 25+ times, largely because I now live a few blocks away but also because it's a consistently reliable place for a meal, drinks or both.
1384<>1<>Some of my Switch favorites:  *The Mozzarella and Chop Salads - unlike some other local restaurants that will go unnamed, Switch's salads aren't all overly sweet (I am so sick of strawberries and candied walnuts!).
1385<>1<>These two, in particular, are hearty but still have feel light and fresh.
1386<>1<>Even the salad that does have the fresh fruit and candied nuts (the House) does a little differently, with fresh blackberries and raspberries and delicious fried onion straws.
1387<>1<>The two seafood appetizers (Lobster/Crab Puffs and the Sesame Shrimp) - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an Asian kick.
1388<>1<>*The veggie burger - so delicious.
1389<>1<>We were surprised to find out the veggie burger wasn't made in house because it certainly tastes like it is.
1390<>1<>It's very filling and doesn't fall apart like most, but still isn't overly formed or artificial.
1391<>1<>Amsterdam Pasta - this is a little heavier than I normally order, but they do a great job making the sauce creamy without overwhelming.
1392<>1<>Extra points for the truffle oil :) *Cheap-ass brunch carafes - while the size of the carafes has reduced in the past few months, you still can't beat $3 Bloody Mary carafes (serve about 3) and $6 mimosa carafes.
1393<>1<>How many lazy Sunday afternoons have I spent downing 2 (or 3) of these delicious concoctions.
1394<>1<>Some of the improvable aspects of the experience:  *The brunch service experience - while I understand it must be frustrating to serve super cheap carafes, they're on the menu and people are there at your restaurant, instead of somewhere else in CenPho with almost-as-cheap drinks.
1395<>1<>So suck it up and don't act like I'm some cheapo or that I can't make a request simply because I'm paying a small amount for booze.
1396<>1<>Last time I went, I asked for a glass with a salted rim with my Bloody Mary carafe and was refused.
1397<>1<>Another time, my friend asked for pineapple juice in the Cape Cod carafe and got a lot of attitude about "changing something that's already cheap."
1398<>1<>Even if he were charged extra (which is fine), the server could have just said that and made the whole thing a lot less awkward.
1399<>1<>*The overly-sweet specialty drinks - most of their daily drink specials are really sugary, with tons of grenadine and syrups.
1400<>1<>I wouldn't mind seeing just a good old vodka soda every now and then.
1401<>1<>*The martinis - I've ordered a dirty martini a few times there and I never will again.
1402<>0<>Must be the olive juice?
1403<>1<>*The brunch food menu - It's quite small and has few vegetarian options.
1404<>1<>Could definitely be expanded.
1405<>1<>I definitely won't stop going to Switch, especially since it's so close, and I've had so many great experiences there, but I'd like to see them invest a little time in fixing some of the cons.
1406<>1<>Positives: +outdoor patio/alley +cheese and fruit plate +pork entree  Negatives: -tight trendy inside of restaurant -average salads -bad parking situation
1407<>1<>I love this place for breakfast.
1408<>1<>With just a few menu choices, it's tough to go wrong.
1409<>1<>My personal fave, the Switch Benedict is a tasty combo of potatoes and eggs benedict is a scrumptious white hollandaise sauce.
1410<>1<>It may not be good for you, but it's great for your tastebuds.
1411<>1<>Sadly, I've never seen this place busy, but seeing as how I've only been there on weekends, I'm not too surprised.
1412<>1<>I expect the light rail to help out a bit with this, as it really is a great place.
1413<>1<>If you like Fez or Ticoz, be sure to hit Switch up.
1414<>1<>Had a great lunch at Switch today!
1415<>0<>The party started with just two people and grew to a party of eight.
1416<>1<>We camped out at Switch for a good 3+ hours and loved every minute of it.
1417<>1<>Several things made this lunch fantastic, in addition to the great friends and delicious food, two specific things earned Switch the extra star.
1418<>1<>1) The Saturday brunch drink specials including the $3 carafes of typical brunch drinks (Cape Cod, Screwdrivers, Bloody Mary's, etc) and $6 pictures of Mimosas.
1419<>1<>2) Our server, Shane.
1420<>1<>Shane was hilarious, patient, friendly, and just one of the best servers our group has had in a long time!
1421<>1<>Let me just say we are not known for leaving alcohol on the table, however today there came a point when we just had to walk away with almost a full carafe untouched.
1422<>1<>(Could have been when we started knocking stuff off the walls and falling asleep at the table?)
1423<>1<>With that being said (or typed) we still got more than our money's worth and a great time was had by all!!
1424<>1<>Thanks again, Shane!
1425<>0<>!
1426<>1<>The first time I went to Switch, I thought I was walking into some posh cavern.
1427<>1<>Relaxing lounge, but unusually dark for an afternoon lunch setting.
1428<>1<>My date and I twiddled our thumbs on top of the long-closed drink menus for a good 10 minutes before our server came back to take our order.
1429<>1<>We had to reel him back in after placing our cocktail requests so that we could also get our food before the witching hour.
1430<>1<>It took an unreasonably long time for our hummus appetizer to arrive - only then did we also receive our sweaty drink glasses.
1431<>1<>The hummus was good, but overwhelmingly garlicky - similar to the dish at Switch's little-bit-nicer brother, Fez.
1432<>1<>From the adjournment of our pre-feast, it took another 15 minutes for our entrees to materialize.
1433<>1<>My date got a chicken sandwich dressed with apricots and other assorted fruit-and-nut bits that took up all of his attention, and occasionally garnered a few food-centric moans.
1434<>1<>As usual, I ordered a tuna sandwich, but was disappointed to find that the mix of fish, mayo, and other tuna salad staples were poorly concocted in some sort of soupy mess.
1435<>1<>I'm not sure if the tuna was not properly drained, or if the chef got mayo-happy, but I couldn't keep most of the contents between the soggy bread slices.
1436<>0<>Bummer.
1437<>1<>We ordered dessert - why not?
1438<>1<>we'd already been there for an hour and a half - and the cheesecake was massive.
1439<>0<>Goliath proportions, I kid you not.
1440<>1<>I am surprised to this day that I did not suffer a diabetic coma from the amount of sugary cream cheese and caramel I shoveled into my greedy belly.
1441<>1<>The dessert saved Switch from a two-star review, but after perusing other recommendations, I'd consider giving it another shot for some of the yummy items mentioned.
1442<>1<>On a day where I have two hours to invest in one meal, of course.
1443<>1<>My husband and I stopped here for drinks and appetizers on our recent trip to Arizona.
1444<>1<>The environment is great for drinks and socializing.
1445<>1<>It's has a nice modern, dark feel to it.
1446<>1<>We ordered their special Pear and Apple Bellini which was yummy.
1447<>1<>It's not a real Bellini by any means since they don't put the real fresh fruit puree in it but it tasted great.
1448<>1<>The calamari we ordered was fresh and delicious.
1449<>1<>The service was great and the waiter was very nice and attentive.
1450<>1<>We stopped here before we went to eat at Durant's next door and since Durant's was horrible, we actually would've wanted to stay and had dinner at Switch instead.
1451<>1<>The rest of the food looked good.
1452<>0<>I only wished we did stay versus going next door.
1453<>1<>I've only been there twice but would definitely eat there again if I was wanting to eat something in the Central Ave. corridor.
1454<>0<>The owners also own Ticos and Fez I believe.
1455<>1<>Out of those three restaurants I would have to say Switch is definitely my hands on favorite.
1456<>1<>The only plates I have eaten was the hummus/pita dip and Mac and Cheese..This is probably best described as "high-end" Americana  but will not make a dent in your wallet.
1457<>1<>The service was good for the most part and the ambiance is perfect.
1458<>1<>It was lunchtime, and It's a Wrap was closed.
1459<>0<>So after a quick scan through yelp on my iPhone, I decided to check out Switch.
1460<>1<>It's located on Central, right next to Durant's, but I had never seen it before.
1461<>1<>We asked to be seated outside and were pleasantly surprised by the adorably chic patio.
1462<>1<>It was slightly reminiscent of some of my favorite LA lunch spots.
1463<>1<>I ordered the farm basket veggie sandwich and was happy to see that it came with a side salad instead of fries (I never have the self discipline to ask for salad instead of fries if they're the standard side).
1464<>1<>The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the salad, while a little bland (cesar dressing on romaine with parmesan shavings), it was still pretty good.
1465<>1<>I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try their mac n' cheese!
1466<>1<>Good food and good service.
1467<>1<>I enjoyed the steak
1468<>1<>The atmosphere has gotten pretty casual, unlike when they first opened, it seemed more elegant back then.
1469<>1<>The food was OK, typical for Las Vegas, nothing to scream about, and the wait staff seems a little on the young side.
1470<>1<>It was a pleasant dinner date, overall, but not sure if this will be my first choice when I go back to LV.
1471<>1<>Aureole is perfect for special occasions because it's beautiful, romantic, fun (with the swinging wine ladies and swans), delicious, expensive and has the most elaborate wine list you'll ever see.
1472<>1<>My fiance and I loved scrolling through the digital wine list searching by region, then type, then price points...etc.
1473<>1<>It's a great place for a slow meal with quality service.
1474<>1<>We had the tasting menu, which was good though not exceptional (which I feel I should point out considering the price).
1475<>1<>I specifically liked their broad selection of breads and their desserts were awesome.
1476<>0<>So keep in mind, as my husband says "we're spoiled".
1477<>1<>No we don't eat at Michelin star restaurants every night, but since living here we've had so much damn good food!
1478<>0<>My standards for a 5 star dining place are really high - I expect the best when I'm shelling out big bucks!
1479<>1<>We were drawn to Aureole by a $50 GC from restaurant.com and an $85 valentines day weekend 5 course menu.
1480<>1<>The menu *sounded* good and we'd never tried Aureole so figured it was a great time to give it a go.
1481<>0<>I think I read the word "Corporate" in someone else's review in describing the atmosphere.
1482<>1<>It was pretty, but it felt like a nice hotel in Sweden or something to me.
1483<>1<>It was cold, austere, modern, but not in a "cool" sense.
1484<>0<>Just kinda blah.
1485<>1<>The wine angel and wine tablet were freaking cool.
1486<>1<>I was however disappointed by their insane prices (only 3 red wines in the entire book under $50 that I could find!)
1487<>1<>and every wine I wanted to drink (favorites from Napa/Italy) weren't in there.
1488<>1<>So much for their huge wine list.
1489<>1<>We did try a $60 or so bottle from Italy and were happy, however.
1490<>0<>Anyways, if you're still with me.. here's the food!
1491<>1<>*Caviar/Smoked Salmon: So incredibly blah and boring.
1492<>1<>I love smoked salmon but this fell flat.
1493<>0<>I had a better smoked salmon appetizer at a wedding I was at recently - sad.
1494<>1<>*Short Rib Ravioli with Foie Gras - This was divine and saved the meal from being one of the most boring meals I've had in a long time.
1495<>1<>*Dover Sole - bland and tasteless.
1496<>1<>I took 2 bites and quit eating it.
1497<>1<>*Beef Wellington - I do love me some Beef Wellington but this was one of the worst I've had.
1498<>1<>Not particularly flavorful and didn't compare to Chef's Palette in Henderson.
1499<>1<>*Dessert - lots of sorbet, some raspberry parfait thing, some icky coffee flavored "tart".
1500<>0<>Nothing to write home about.
1501<>1<>Overall I was pretty disappointed by this pricey dinner.
1502<>1<>None of the food was awful, but it was so freaking boring and bland I felt like I was eating cruise line food or catered food.
1503<>1<>There weren't those special touches you get at Alex (amuse bouche platter, special desserts,etc) and for $40 more per person I wish I had spent my money there instead!
1504<>1<>For the record I also was pretty disappointed by Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons.
1505<>0<>Maybe his NYC outposts are good, but his Vegas restaurants could really use some work!
1506<>0<>Put this one on your list especially if your a wine nut.
1507<>1<>Its one of my favorite places in Vegas.
1508<>1<>The wine list is served on a tablet PC because if you printed it it would resemble a phone book.
1509<>1<>Excellent service and fantastic food.
1510<>1<>Last night I ate there with a large group the room works for 35 -40 but gets crowded if the group is larger than that.
1511<>1<>I've been here twice thus far, and I have enjoyed it.
1512<>1<>The service is good.
1513<>1<>Some of the servers are excellent, and others can seem a little more pretentious.
1514<>1<>In general, the food is very good.
1515<>0<>I did the pre-fixe menu the 1st visit, and it was a while ago, so I don't remember what I had, but I remember liking it enough to come back.
1516<>1<>At that time, the server even brought me some extra goodies for free, so that was nice.
1517<>0<>They are also on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good discount here.
1518<>1<>On my recent visit, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with duck confit.
1519<>1<>This was a very nice mix of flavors.
1520<>1<>The foie gras was also good, but I actually had better foie gras the night before at Stripsteak next door.
1521<>1<>The cheese plate was good.
1522<>1<>I also had the salmon, which was good but not great.
1523<>1<>I definitely enjoyed the pre fixe menu I ordered on my 1st visit better than the choices I made on my most recent visit.
1524<>1<>So the take home message here is not to trust myself to know how to order properly :)    Also, they bring an assortment of four breads at the beginning (including pretzel bread), but they are all served cold, which is not pleasing.
1525<>0<>Who likes cold bread better than warm bread?
1526<>1<>Plus, they seem very excited about their wine list and the "wine angels" on harnesses who go get your wines for you.
1527<>0<>I have a better idea... why not charge admission and strap the guest into the harness and he/she can go get his/her own wine.
1528<>0<>Dinner and a ride!
1529<>1<>I want to give them 3 stars for the most recent visit, but 4 stars for the initial visit.
1530<>0<>I guess I rounded up.
1531<>1<>The overall average rating of 3.5 stars is very accurate.
1532<>1<>First of the lack of rating is due to service, food was really good.
1533<>0<>We went for happy hour.
1534<>1<>Had the best rib ever!
1535<>1<>The service was less than desirable.
1536<>1<>First off it was just slower, which was not a big deal.
1537<>1<>Then in my last bite of a slider there was a small piece of plastic.
1538<>0<>I told the server and he just took it and walked to another employee whom I thought was manager.
1539<>1<>They did not come over did not apologize and in fact never really spoke to us again.
1540<>1<>And there was no offer to comp or reduce cost.
1541<>1<>All they need to do to save this visit is act like they cared.
1542<>0<>I guess I should have just choked on the piece.
1543<>1<>Once you get past the entrance with wine tower, the dining area decor is a little dated... feels like it was designed by the Hilton Memphis from about 15 yrs ago.
1544<>1<>Wine list is impressive.
1545<>1<>The parallel tasting menu provides 8 different tastes in 4 courses which is nice if you enjoy a lot of variety.
1546<>1<>Also really enjoyed the Niman Ranch Double Cut Pork Chop and the Roasted Garlic Pomme Puree which is absolute buttery bliss.
1547<>1<>Service is a little stuffy and the waiters need to brush up on their English pronunciation and listening abilities.
1548<>1<>Luckily the food is tasty because otherwise, I wouldn't be giving it 4 stars and planning on going back in the future.
1549<>0<>You know out of all the reviews of this restaurant it is amazing to me how the overall reviews are "good".
1550<>1<>But yet some dorks who are obviously cheap and have no sense of class can't appreciate the ambiance and the amount of hard work that goes into running a restaurant of this size.
1551<>0<>The next time you choose to dine here look at the servers and the diligence that each one has to ensure that you have a good time.
1552<>0<>Instead of criticizing the food know ahead of time what your ordering.
1553<>0<>Instead of criticizing the waiter because you can't understand him, remember he's not on welfare or unemployment, he's supporting a family.
1554<>0<>And above all if your not happy with something you can always ask to speak to a manager.
1555<>1<>It has been my experience that they also do there best to make your evening a good one.
1556<>1<>The wine angles are kind of what you pay for.
1557<>1<>The food was merely adequate for the price.
1558<>1<>They must have let the Michelin critic fly around in the wine tower to earn the star.
1559<>1<>Cover was $10.
1560<>1<>I guess rather cheap for anything on the strip with music.
1561<>0<>The all upscale clubs are all going for about $30 each.
1562<>1<>Pretty casual, we got in with Tennies on.
1563<>1<>The alcohol was strong and of course pricey (but where on the strip wouldn't it be).
1564<>1<>The music was good....hip hop and then trance.
1565<>1<>I like both so it was great for me.
1566<>1<>It's a good mix of ppl.
1567<>1<>The pseudo go-go dancers had huge bottles of SKY VODKA in there hands and were dancing on stage pouring shots to those that tipped them............boy was I deceived.....it was just PINEAPPLE JUICE!!!
1568<>0<>LMAO!!!
1569<>1<>Cool to chill if you're not dressed and don't know where else to go when you've just driven 4 hours after from LA to VEGAS....
1570<>1<>The Nachos here are unreal.
1571<>1<>They are enough for almost 7 people and piled high with peppers and cheese.
1572<>1<>You have your option of Steak, Pork, or Chicken.
1573<>1<>We did the pork and it was awesome!
1574<>1<>Dont forget to grab a margarita!
1575<>1<>One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.
1576<>1<>Great music, great vibe and most importantly great food.
1577<>1<>Their buffalo wings are some of the best I have ever had and drinks are really affordable too.
1578<>1<>Overall a great place if you want to catch a game so or simply to dine out.
1579<>1<>Love the street tacos and sinful vixen cocktail.
1580<>1<>It's a Lil pricey but nice atmosphere and good location.
1581<>1<>I always come here when I visit vegas.
1582<>1<>The service is good I usually get Janet cuz she is pretty good with recommendations on food and drinks and always tells us what the hot spots are.
1583<>0<>I've definitely had better.
1584<>1<>The food was great!
1585<>1<>But the service SUCKED!!
1586<>0<>We decided to eat a late lunch and figured we would miss the crowd, we did which was nice.
1587<>1<>The place looks cool, and has an upstairs bar that looks over the strip.
1588<>1<>All of us enjoyed our food but as I said the service was not good.
1589<>1<>We waited 15 minutes for the waiter to ask what drinks we wanted and then another 10 for the drinks to arrive (a soda, water, and 2 margaritas).
1590<>1<>Our food was taken to the wrong table sat there for 10 minutes then they realized the mistake and brought them to us, we refused to accept them and demanded a new appetizer.
1591<>1<>Then later in the meal my sister asked for an extra pickle with her burger and they said it would cost $1.00.
1592<>1<>Also, she was going to get another soda and they wanted to charge her for another and she declined.
1593<>1<>Over priced, bad service, but good food.
1594<>0<>Your choice.
1595<>1<>So I have this phobia of lines...long lines.
1596<>0<>And when it comes to Vegas clubs on the weekend you can usually expect to wait.
1597<>1<>But not for me at Diablos Cantina!
1598<>1<>I gotta say usually when im in vegas I'm all about the fancy resturants and playing pretentious, but this place won a special place in my heart.
1599<>1<>The drinks where cheap, the dancers where hot....and friendly, and the dance floor wasn't crap.
1600<>1<>I'd come back here to get wasted enough to forget half of it any time!
1601<>1<>I love this place!
1602<>1<>It's always consistent and the service this most recent time on my birthday was no exception!
1603<>1<>My server was Jazz,, I think short for Jasmine,, she was very professional and attentive, and also drop dead gorgeous.
1604<>1<>Made my day !
1605<>1<>The bald bartender guy who has been there awhile even seemed somewhat chipper which I've never seen.
1606<>0<>Thanks Diablos!
1607<>0<>I wish there were more places like Diablo's on the strip.
1608<>1<>You can walk right up to the bar from the sidewalk and grab a beer.
1609<>1<>But like just about anywhere on Las Vegas Boulevard, it cost me $8 for a domestic draught.
1610<>1<>That sucks.
1611<>1<>The bar area is huge and there's plenty of seats.
1612<>1<>Like a previous review says, the layout and atmosphere is fun and comfortable.
1613<>1<>Music is going but it's not deafening.
1614<>1<>I would recommend Diablo's for a rendezvous point to grab a drink, do some people watching and decide what to do next.
1615<>0<>I can't speak for the food.
1616<>1<>Food is okay nothing special.
1617<>1<>Every plate will run you about $16 dollars.
1618<>1<>Service is a bit slow.
1619<>1<>Share a plate with someone if you can.
1620<>1<>I know this place is on the strip, but $55 for 4 drinks??
1621<>0<>You've got to be kidding me.
1622<>0<>I was here with a group of people celebrating a friend's birthday.
1623<>1<>The table service was pretty good considering that we had a party of 15.
1624<>1<>Seating was quick and the food came out quickly.
1625<>1<>I had the pork burrito and it came with beans, rice, and salsa.
1626<>1<>I swear it was comparable to Taco Bell and more than 3 times the price.
1627<>1<>It's a pretty restaurant and conveniently connected to Monte Carlo (I won $67 waiting for my friends).
1628<>1<>I don't think it's worth the price.
1629<>0<>I read the reviews on Yelp, and was all excited to try this place.
1630<>0<>So it's 1am on a rainy, thunderstormy night in Vegas, but I press on to sample the Earl's tuna melt sandwich.
1631<>1<>I was craving a good tuna melt, and from the photos on Earl's website, it looked like I was in for a huge, delicious sandwich.
1632<>0<>Not the case.
1633<>1<>There was barely enough tuna on my sandwich to give it even a slight tuna flavor.
1634<>1<>The bread was the main thing I tasted.
1635<>0<>Definately not the double-layer of tuna depicted on their website.
1636<>1<>For $6.49, I felt I was overcharged.
1637<>0<>To top it off, when I was done, I showed the photo of the tuna melt from their website to the Manager (Marc).
1638<>1<>He said "they sure make it look big on the website, obviously they're making it look like a lot more than it is".
1639<>1<>He then simply offered me a "sorry boss" and then turned and walked away, no offer to remake my sandwich, refund my money, maybe comp me a brownie or anything.
1640<>1<>Left with a bad taste in my mouth.
1641<>1<>Oh, and to top it off, they were repairing the floors in the seating area, and the workers were using blowtorches to heat up the vinyl flooring (looks like wood, but it's vinyl).
1642<>1<>It gave off noxious odors while I was eating at one of the two available tables.
1643<>1<>I definately won't be in any hurry to return, I've had much better sandwiches at the Carnegie Deli in Vegas, and at Gaglione Bros. subs in San Diego!
1644<>1<>The sandwiches served here are heaven on bread.
1645<>1<>I don't know what they do to make these things so damn good but I eat here way too much during a Vegas trip.
1646<>1<>The bread is so freaking good all warm fresh and toasty.
1647<>1<>It's like the toaster it goes through is baking and toasting the bread all at once.
1648<>1<>I have not been disappointed with any sandwich I have ordered here.
1649<>1<>They also have these chocolate chip brownie cream filled sandwiches that are outstanding.
1650<>1<>It is the bee's knees here!
1651<>0<>I think I had it to eat 3 times in one day during a trip.
1652<>1<>That's how damn good it is
1653<>1<>For both the Las Vegas Strip location and Downtown Disney, Earl's is one of the best and satisfying "quick snacks".
1654<>1<>During an afternoon of belligerent drinking or after a night of partying, grabbing a sandwich from here isn't a bad choice if you don't feel like having a $5 pizza.
1655<>1<>All the sandwiches I've tried have been pretty consistent: not bad, but nothing special.
1656<>1<>The two I particularly enjoy are the Tuna and Holiday Turkey.
1657<>1<>I'm pretty picky about my tuna and this place rounds up a pretty decent melt.. chunky bites of tuna on their crispy Artisan bread, too good.
1658<>1<>The holiday turkey is probably one of my favorite sandwiches ever.
1659<>1<>I love all the ingredients that make up the sandwich: turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry!
1660<>0<>Thanksgiving in a sandwich.
1661<>1<>Yummm!
1662<>1<>Earl's also offer plenty of other snacks: wraps, soups, salads, chips, drinks, etc.. but all you really need is a sandwich and a complimentary cocktail from the casino, and you're all good!
1663<>1<>This location is always busy, usually backed up with a line.
1664<>1<>I think it's definitely worth it though if you're hungry and looking for a cheap choice.
1665<>1<>Dear Earl of Sandwich,  thank you so muchhh for being open odd hours of the night in vegas when I'm drunk and just need some food to fill me up!
1666<>1<>I can always count on you to have no lines and friendly staff who will understand my slurred speech when I order the Earl Club!
1667<>1<>Can't go wrong with this place weather you're drunk and hungry or just plain hungry.
1668<>1<>Sandwiches are good and they have a great selection.
1669<>0<>Late night, a beautiful women approached me in Vegas while eating at the Earl of Sandwich.
1670<>0<>Her body illuminated the darkest corner of the restaurant with a glittering light show... her parting lips asked me if i wanted some entertainment for the night.
1671<>0<>Her face shimmered endless hours of fun...
1672<>0<>I had to reply.
1673<>0<>"I'm so sorry I can't ...
1674<>1<>I'm too full."
1675<>1<>Damn you Full Montagu with deli mustard!!!
1676<>1<>Damn you too Cannon Balls!!
1677<>0<>!
1678<>1<>Very good sandwiches, my wife and i ordered two diff sandwiches and a split em.
1679<>1<>Service is very fast considering the 24/7 long lines.
1680<>1<>The best part about this place is the location, it is right across the way from the PH sports book!
1681<>1<>The only sandwich I tried was their Tuna Melt but it here but it had to be the best Tuna Melt I've ever had...so good in fact, that I had to go back again for another one!
1682<>1<>The bread was perfectly toasted so that it was crunchy but still also soft on the inside, it had a generous amount of Tuna with just the right amount of cheese so that it's not overly greasy.
1683<>1<>My other girlfriends ordered some of the other sandwiches like The Earl and Cannonball and they raved that those were just as yummy too.
1684<>1<>One sandwich is pretty filling by itself but if you have room I'd also recommend their potato soup.
1685<>1<>It's tasty and hearty and doesn't taste processed or canned like some soups I've tried at other sandwich places.
1686<>1<>To top it off, their service is really quick too.
1687<>1<>On our first visit, we called ahead to order 10 sandwiches and had only a short wait before our order was ready for us to pick up.
1688<>1<>Even during the "after club" hours, we probably waited less than a minute before our order was ready.
1689<>1<>Tasty sandwiches - Caribbean jerk chicken and Hawaiian were pretty good
1690<>1<>Now open 24 hours, this is a great place for late night eats to go or sit in after a few rounds on the strip.
1691<>1<>Go here if you are staying in or about the Planet Hollywood area.
1692<>1<>Decently priced, there are a number of sandwiches for any taste.
1693<>1<>The bread is freshly baked and the signature hot sandwiches has a quizno's warmth to it.
1694<>1<>We had the Earl's Club and Hawaiian BBQ.
1695<>1<>Both sandwiches were hearty; yet, easy to eat.
1696<>1<>There was a great ratio of meat to veggies and the condiments for each sandwich added the right punch to round out the flavors.
1697<>1<>The pasta salad was so-so; go for the chips.
1698<>1<>Depending on when you hit up this place, you can breeze through the line and make it out of there within 10 minutes or get in queue with other hungry folk.
1699<>1<>Bottom line, if you are looking for something affordable, good, and to-go -- go here.
1700<>1<>I'm going from strictly memory of my Earl of Sandwich experience.
1701<>0<>My fat Hawaiian friend recommended this spot and after building his creditability with the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan, I gave in.
1702<>1<>Earl's is pretty easy to find and is right across from the Sugar Factory.
1703<>1<>The sandwich shop was pretty busy, but it could of been the holiday, 4th of July.
1704<>1<>The menu is extensive and consists of hot sandwiches, salads & wraps, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages and smoothies.
1705<>1<>I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.
1706<>1<>The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.
1707<>1<>The sandwich was mouth watering delicious.
1708<>1<>The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.
1709<>1<>The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste.
1710<>1<>The food was awesome, but I do suggest ordering a large or two sandwiches, as I was left somewhat unfilled after my regular sized sandwich.
1711<>1<>It's no five star sandwich but it's damn close.
1712<>0<>Hubby and I were back at Pappadeaux last Monday.
1713<>1<>Right off the bat I will say that I have never gone to Pappadeaux and not had at least a 15 minute wait.
1714<>1<>There have been times that I was quoted a 1.5 hour wait.
1715<>1<>Waiting sucks but the food is worth it.
1716<>1<>Personally a 45 minute wait is my cut off but if there is a seat at the bar I will get a few drinks while waiting.
1717<>1<>We were seated and the waitress explained that she was training so we expected to possibly experience a couple hiccups.
1718<>1<>We ordered a dozen oysters, fried gator and shared a blackened salmon and salad.
1719<>1<>Our oysters and gator came out immediately with bread and butter.
1720<>1<>Everything was excellent.
1721<>1<>Then we waited for our entree and salad....and waited...and waited.
1722<>1<>After about 15 to 20 minutes our waitress came by and apologized and let us know that our entree was coming.
1723<>0<>I tried to play it cool and not act agitated but at this point we knew we would miss the movie that we had planned on seeing after eating.
1724<>0<>I requested that she bring out our salad while we wait for our entree.
1725<>1<>Our waitress arrived 5 minutes later with our entree and salad in hand and once again apologized for the wait.
1726<>1<>She also explained that our there was an issue with our salmon when the chef split our meal onto two plates and that she would be bringing us out another fillet shortly.
1727<>1<>BTW, it is nice that it was split for 2 but I would have been equally happy to share from the same plate, however I do see this as an over and above service and appreciate these little efforts.
1728<>1<>She also offered to bring us a dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the wait and the problem with the salmon.
1729<>1<>The food was all delicious and as promised the waitress brought out the dessert tray and asked what we would like to try.
1730<>1<>We went for the creme brulee which did not disappoint.
1731<>1<>Our check did not include the dessert and we were given half off our oysters.
1732<>1<>This is why I adore Pappadeaux.
1733<>0<>If there is a problem they go way beyond to fix it and make it up to you.
1734<>1<>I love this restaurant.
1735<>1<>Whenever I'm in Phoenix for work, I make sure I stop by.
1736<>1<>The service is wonderful and the food is pretty damn good.
1737<>1<>I love the soft shell crabs with a load mashed potato.
1738<>1<>I've also tried the Alaskan King Crab, Lobster, and Salmon and Pappadeaux never dissapoints.
1739<>1<>They sometimes have specials for a half dozen oysters for only $5.
1740<>1<>I'm from Los Angeles and I wished they tore down all the Red Lobsters and Joe's Crab Shacks and opened a couple of these restaurants closer to home.
1741<>0<>My bestie and I came in for dinner a few weeks ago.
1742<>1<>Everything was perfect.
1743<>1<>The food is by far some of the best I've had in a while.
1744<>1<>I definitely recommend the spinach and lump crab dip, the Mahi Mahi, and the creme brulee.
1745<>1<>The ambiance is dim, lively, and very New Orleans.
1746<>0<>Our server, LeAndrew (sp?)
1747<>1<>was perfect and made us laugh the whole time (a couple of times I'm pretty sure he didn't mean too; he was just so accommodating it made us smile).
1748<>1<>Additionally, any staff member who walked by made sure to clear our dirty dishes and fill our only half empty waters.
1749<>1<>Even though it is far from my Mesa home base I WILL be returning!
1750<>1<>While in the Phoenix area I decided to have dinner here on a friend recommendation.
1751<>1<>The food is absolutely the best.
1752<>1<>I had the seafood, sausage gumbo.
1753<>1<>Absolutely the best.
1754<>1<>No skimping on the seafood or sausage.
1755<>1<>The breaded, fried alligator was a little spicy for my wife, but it was great for me.
1756<>0<>Went back the second nite for dinner.
1757<>1<>Wait staff very good, service very good.
1758<>1<>Would go back again.
1759<>1<>If you like any kind of seafood, this is the place for you!
1760<>1<>The trio-appetizer is amazing.
1761<>1<>Crawfish and shrimp fondeux, fried alligator (better than I had in NOLA!)
1762<>0<>and calamari.
1763<>1<>Next course was lobster bisque, which is easiest the best I've ever had!!
1764<>1<>I had the stuffed shrimp for dinner and it was perfect.
1765<>1<>My boyfriend had the Mardi Gras pasta and the sausage in it was the best thing on the table.
1766<>1<>I had the sweet potato pecan pie for dessert and I could eat a whole pie of that!
1767<>1<>The creme brûlée looked awesome, but no one at the table ordered it.
1768<>0<>That will be for next time.
1769<>1<>I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving creole or seafood...or both!!
1770<>1<>It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!
1771<>1<>Great place to get authentic creole food!
1772<>0<>Never been and my niece recommended.
1773<>1<>I loved the selection of food, and drinks.
1774<>1<>If you want to know how people in New Orleans eat, try this place!
1775<>1<>I loved it and will be back soon...
1776<>1<>We LOVE pappadeaux and go every time we are close to one.
1777<>1<>Never have been disappointed.
1778<>1<>We started at the bar with a couple happy hour grey goose lemon drops.
1779<>1<>Coconut shrimp app followed by cedar plank salmon and stuffed shrimp (unbelievably delish!).
1780<>1<>We also added some king crab legs and a beer and blood orange mojito.
1781<>1<>Got out for $112 including $20 tip.
1782<>1<>Service was top notch food was phenomenal, if I had to knock something the crab legs were a little soggy.
1783<>1<>Server immediately tried to replace them or comp them but I can't waste crab legs so I ate every scrap of them!
1784<>1<>Can't wait to go back.
1785<>0<>Came here for mother's day!
1786<>1<>It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad and they had a band and drinks while you were waiting.
1787<>1<>We got Calamari for the app.
1788<>1<>It was your typical Calamari.
1789<>0<>My sister and I shared the Sampler Platter.
1790<>1<>It had Tilipia, Shrimp, and Chicken with fries.
1791<>1<>We got full pretty fast, and it was really good.
1792<>1<>I don't normally like seafood, but it was all fried and good.
1793<>1<>Dessert we shared the turtle brownie...It was a little dry and needed to be warmer.
1794<>1<>Our server was really outgoing and funny.
1795<>1<>It was super busy so it took her awhile to get to us, but she was a good waitress.
1796<>1<>Made us laugh quite a bit.
1797<>1<>I'd like to go back on a calmer day to see if the quality was lacking because of the Mother's Day rush.
1798<>1<>I am all about good Cajun food.
1799<>0<>I wasn't expecting to find it in Phoenix, but I sure did!
1800<>1<>I had catfish with shrimp etouffe, and the traditional calamari as an appetizer.
1801<>1<>The calamari tasted fresh, and wasn't like the cheap rubberband-like calamari you find at bad restaurants.
1802<>1<>The catfish was light and flaky, but the shrimp etouffe was my favorite by far.
1803<>1<>The decor reminded me of New Orleans.
1804<>1<>It was beautiful weather to sit outside, and the waiter was prompt and friendly.
1805<>0<>Seafood Grandeur.
1806<>1<>Reminded me fondly of the great seafood days I had in New England and Boston in the past.
1807<>1<>The fish and chips (two-headed fried shrimp, fried tilapia, french fries) is so very New England.
1808<>1<>The Blackened Mahi Alexander is so creative they put shredded crawfish on top.
1809<>1<>You may choose something other as an entree, but please do yourself a favor and order the Lobster Bisque, which isn't only brisk bisque but also generous with lobster bites.
1810<>1<>You'll be full, so don't even dream of somersaults afterwards not unless you're purging.
1811<>0<>Review for takeaway only.
1812<>1<>Place has changed a bit - used to have more pastry in the morning from what I recall on previous trips here.
1813<>1<>Coffee was meh on this occasion- almond croissant almost made up for the crap coffee
1814<>0<>my first visit to Payard was last december...i went for the prix fixe dinner...which is a three course dessert for dinner deal.
1815<>1<>for the price it wasn't bad and the service was great.
1816<>1<>they started us off with a savory amuse.
1817<>1<>the desserts i had were great, too.
1818<>1<>i raved and raved to my friends when i got back, so on this most recent trip my friend and i went to payard bistro hoping to experience the prix fixe dessert for dinner, only to find out that they were no longer offering dinner at all!
1819<>1<>just breakfast and lunch, to our dismay.
1820<>1<>but since it was lunch time, my friend and i gave it a whirl.
1821<>1<>we started off by sharing a caesar salad...had anchovies and a poached egg.
1822<>1<>it was by far one of the best caesar salads i've had.
1823<>1<>i followed that with eggs benedict on a croissant instead of an english muffin.
1824<>1<>it was so light and tasty...i'm a big fan of eggs benedict in general but usually get weighed down with the hollandaise sauce, but the hollandaise at payard had a big zing of citrus which just made it that much better for me.
1825<>1<>my friend had the braised short ribs and she liked that as well.
1826<>1<>we both followed it up with dessert...i mean, come on, it's a patisserie...of course you have to have dessert!
1827<>1<>i had the beaux arts, a cassis mousse, and my friend had the louvre, a chocolate and hazelnut mousse concoction.
1828<>1<>both were great and can also be purchased at the walk up counter right next door.
1829<>1<>after we were done with lunch, we popped in over to the walk up counter and got a "picasso" truffle...dark chocolate infused with earl grey tea.
1830<>1<>a perfect ending.
1831<>1<>Payard is pretty good, but it doesn't live up to the hype nor the prices.
1832<>1<>Granted, I only ate at the take-away counter rather than eat in, but if you're going to have a take-away counter its pastries and food should be just as good as that in the restaurant.
1833<>1<>We had an overcooked almond croissant (amandines are my favorite), a good plain croissant, a mediocre ham and cheese quiche, and a very good croque monsieur (ham and cheese, essentially).
1834<>1<>So it's hit and miss.
1835<>1<>The coffee was so watery that we returned it to the surly server, who at least gave us more recently-brewed coffee that was still slightly watery.
1836<>1<>Difficult to find in the labyrinth of Caeser's Palace, maybe Payard is worth the trouble and money if you sit inside.
1837<>1<>But as is, it's an okay French place with just above reasonable prices.
1838<>0<>There are other places to go in this town.
1839<>1<>Very good and fresh...
1840<>1<>The Nutella crepe was great, they are very generous with the Nutella ...
1841<>1<>I love their desserts here!
1842<>0<>It's a little hidden in Ceasar's Palace (or maybe it's just because it's a huge place and I wasn't familiar with where I was going..Haha) I had their gelato and boy oh boy!
1843<>1<>It's so flavorful and robust.
1844<>1<>Just the perfect amount of sweetness too!
1845<>1<>I bought boxes of macaroons to take home for my family and friends.
1846<>1<>They come in really cute packages and hardcover boxes so there's less chance of it getting crushed.
1847<>0<>I still had them in my carry-on just to be safe ;p
1848<>1<>Payard is one of the main reasons I go to Las Vegas.
1849<>1<>The almond croissant is better than most I've had in France.
1850<>1<>The pastries are As beautiful to look at - as they are wonderful to eat.
1851<>1<>Petite edible works of art, pleasing to the eye and amazing to the palette.
1852<>1<>I normally buy about a dz croissants aux amandes to take back to CA to tide me over until the next trip to LV or NYC.
1853<>1<>They freeze well.
1854<>1<>Kudos to the chef for adding his flair to French classics.
1855<>0<>She said..." So we only had about 10 mins to spare for breakfast before leaving caesars.
1856<>1<>So we got the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, sooo yummy.
1857<>1<>It was on the ciabatta bread which was really warm and fresh tasting.
1858<>1<>There was egg with spinach in it, bacon and some type of cheese, not sure what kind.
1859<>1<>It was really yummy and filling.
1860<>1<>We also go their homemade crossiants, they were really flaky and warm.
1861<>1<>They also have deserts, crepes, ice cream and a lot of other homemade pasteries.
1862<>1<>I would go back here next time im at casears."
1863<>0<>He said," So for a last minute breakfast before we left...this wasn't a bad deal.
1864<>1<>We split a cheese, egg and bacon sandwich and it was probably one of the best I've had.
1865<>1<>Prices are steep...and I wouldn't recommend buying the 7 dollar orange juice...thats just redic...Also I wouldn't eat the crossiant and the sandwich in the taxi...we made a mess inside...too many flakes...very good food..thats not shipped in by truck frozen...yea like starbucks hard as a rock crossiants.."
1866<>0<>Located in Ceasar's Palace, Payard Patisserie is actually kinda hard to find if you're not a regular.
1867<>0<>The casino is a bit of a maze as is the Ceasar's Palace in general.
1868<>0<>It might help to ask for directions, and if the servers can't point it out, ask for Rao's (the famous Italian joint across the hall).
1869<>1<>But I assure you that finding the famed Patisserie is worth your while.
1870<>0<>I, admittedly, found out about this place via Food Network.
1871<>1<>As one who love macarons, I had to come by since I was there.
1872<>1<>Since we were already there, we also ordered some "extras" (snacks and goodies) to devour.
1873<>1<>I recall the Lourve, which is a domed hazelnut mousse topped with a dark chocolate ganache.
1874<>1<>YUM.
1875<>1<>A dynamite Napoleon which whose crust was very flaky and yummy.
1876<>1<>Along with a couple other pastries.
1877<>1<>Oh and then there's the price... their stuff doesn't come cheap.
1878<>1<>A bag of macarons (about 6 I'd say) costs about $10.
1879<>1<>Each pastry is about $7... so yeah...
1880<>0<>But I suppose it's Las Vegas, things don't go for that cheap there.
1881<>1<>They do serve bistro options as well like quiches and sandwiches like panini's.
1882<>1<>I'd go back for the macarons, but I wish that I could pick which ones I want.
1883<>0<>But sadly, they are pre-packaged.
1884<>1<>Wow yum!
1885<>1<>I love this place...definitely a quiet spot that is similar to Jean Phillipe but lesser known and arguably better.
1886<>1<>Berry crepe: Small yet delicious.
1887<>1<>I do think that Jean Phillipe has better sweet crepes as the crepe skin here is a bit too dense (its folded into a square) for my liking.
1888<>1<>Banana caramel crepe: I actually did not like this too much.
1889<>1<>Too sweet for my liking and the skin seemed even denser as it was drenched in heavy syrup.
1890<>1<>It's not bad for those of you super sweet tooth people though.
1891<>1<>White chocolate mocha: VERY good!
1892<>1<>Sweet and you can definitely taste the white chocolate (most places just taste like sweet syrup).
1893<>1<>A hint of light espresso...very yummy!
1894<>1<>Fruit cup: Fresh fruit...VERY fresh fruit.
1895<>1<>I don't like how the melons and pineapple were chopping into tiny pieces, but I can see how some people would like it.
1896<>1<>Fruit is sweet and yummy, but for $8...owch.
1897<>1<>Savory madame crepe: Swiss cheese, ham, sunny side up egg.
1898<>0<>Wow.
1899<>1<>Each bite was overflowing with melted cheese and it was just a mouth explosion!
1900<>1<>I would definitely get this!
1901<>1<>Chocolate trio: White chocolate is AMAZING!
1902<>1<>Sweet and delicate...dark chocolate is yummy too, light and not bitter.
1903<>1<>Surprisingly, milk chocolate paled in comparison to the other two, but it wasn't bad.
1904<>1<>Macaron: Pistachio is full of nutty almond-pistachio flavor!
1905<>1<>DELICIOUS!
1906<>1<>Passion fruit is also full of flavor and good, and the vanilla bean blew my mind!
1907<>1<>You can taste the vanilla bean (none of that fake vanilla crap) and it is definitely the best I've ever had.
1908<>1<>The purple macaron which I can't figure out what it is...is not so great.
1909<>1<>That one tasted completely off, but other than that...amazing!
1910<>1<>Overall, this place is big competition for Jean Phillipe in terms of savory crepes and drinks.
1911<>1<>Less of a line and smaller store than Jean Phillipe, making it a good alternative as a breakfast or quick snack place.
1912<>1<>Had a ton of vouchers from a timeshare that we used here for breakfast and brunch.
1913<>1<>Quiet, peaceful, continental and fresh.
1914<>1<>Try their breakfast "buffet" of sorts.
1915<>1<>So yummy and classy buffet isn't a befitting word.
1916<>1<>Beautiful flaky crispy and sweet light pastries, and crisp lean but richly warm coffee.
1917<>1<>Have the croque Madame or croque mr. To start your day off right.
1918<>1<>Hands down, best brewery in Az.
1919<>1<>Great food, excellent beers.
1920<>1<>Been coming here since they opened and Im glad I live close.
1921<>1<>Cute restaurant/brewery in Old Towne Chandler.
1922<>0<>Parking is an issue but once you park and get seated [I recommend outdoors near a heater!!
1923<>0<>], definitely take note of one of their 'home brews'.
1924<>1<>I started out with the Hefewiezen and really enjoyed the light taste and overall crispness of the beer.
1925<>1<>My second round was the Devil's Ale [hail ASU!]
1926<>1<>and I thoroughly enjoyed that more because of the intense hoppyness [suggested thank to our server].
1927<>1<>It just had more flavor than the Hefe.
1928<>1<>Beers in my party were all well-ejoyed.
1929<>0<>Food-wise: everyone loved dinner.
1930<>1<>I took up the suggestion per Yelpers to get the Stuffed Mushroom Burger.
1931<>1<>I asked for Medium/Medium Well with medium-to-little pink & was granted with a LOT of pink.
1932<>1<>Because I was hangry I didn't notice until the burger was close to being extinct.
1933<>1<>Be sure to specify how much pink you want, otherwise you'll get the maximum amount.
1934<>1<>Salad - DEFINITELY get the homemade orange-chipotle vinaigrette.
1935<>1<>It's got a slight kick, but balances out well with the orange.
1936<>1<>Definitely a weird/interesting flavor profile to have that much orange in a salad dressing, but very refreshing.
1937<>0<>This review is based on the beer only, as we didn't order food.
1938<>1<>These beers were some of the best we had on our vacation!
1939<>1<>We got the sampler of them all, and they were all good with complex flavors of deliciousness!
1940<>1<>Their mimosa had their beer in it, which was a wonderful twist I will remember in the future.
1941<>1<>Their black IPA with nitrogen was great, and the stout was dark, thick but oh so smooth!
1942<>1<>Definitely recommend their beer if your in the area.
1943<>0<>My husband and I met some friends here on a Friday night around 6.
1944<>1<>First, the parking sucks!
1945<>0<>There just isn't any.
1946<>1<>Second, it's packed so expect to wait for a table.
1947<>1<>The food however was great or at least what we ordered was.
1948<>1<>I ordered the shaved rib eye cheese steak and it was so good I couldn't believe it!
1949<>1<>They make it with shaved ribeye some kind of good cheese, banana peppers all on their own beer bread which is kind of like pita bread but made with their beer.
1950<>1<>It's is so good!
1951<>1<>My husband thinks the banana peppers make it too spicy so he opts to not have them on his.
1952<>1<>I think the amount of spiciness it adds is perfect.
1953<>1<>We also got the nachos on their app menu and the nacho portion was huge!!!!!
1954<>1<>It had all kinds of stuff you would expect to see on Nachos.
1955<>1<>Sour Cream, guac, tomatoes, olives, beef, and I think it even had black beans.
1956<>1<>I would recommend them if you like nachos.
1957<>1<>We also got the pork pibble one time when we went.
1958<>1<>It's excellent.
1959<>1<>I think it was on a special they had that night.
1960<>1<>It's a spicy roasted pork that they serve with black beans and tortillas.
1961<>1<>The kids loved the chicken tenders and the sliders.
1962<>1<>The chicken was juicy and they weren't those frozen pieces that come out of a bag.
1963<>1<>The portion size was good also.
1964<>1<>My recommendation is, if you don't like waiting then go early or don't go on the weekend.
1965<>1<>This place has helped downtown Chandler become a great place to hangout at on a Friday or Saturday night!!
1966<>0<>I have lived in Chandler all my life and downtown Chandler was never a place to go on the weekends, or any day really.
1967<>0<>However, after they remodeled and San Tan came in, Chandler has been more and more increasing in its popularity.
1968<>0<>I have never been to San Tan, and the place not be packed.
1969<>1<>However, no matter how busy it gets, the service is always great.
1970<>1<>The beer and food selection is also top notch for a brewery.
1971<>1<>In fact, their hummus platter rivals even the best greek places in the valley in my opinion.
1972<>1<>No matter if you need a place for happy hour or even dinner, San Tan is a great place to go.
1973<>1<>If you like beer - you will love the SanTan Brewing Company.
1974<>1<>Not only do they have a great selection of microbrews, but also they LOVE beer.
1975<>1<>Even their glasses are specially made to offer the beer drinker the optimal experience (like wine glasses).
1976<>1<>The staff can't be beat, professional and savvy - they can take what you are familiar with and find something you are sure to enjoy.
1977<>1<>Incredibly friendly, halfway through my first visit there I felt like a regular.
1978<>1<>The food, while of the bar variety, is always fresh and tasty, I personally recommend the pretzels - the mustard they come with is worth the trip alone.
1979<>1<>They have a decent sized patio, with an inside/outside bar service.
1980<>1<>Misters help keep you cool in the summer, as well as an external ac that worked great even in August.
1981<>1<>Great gourmet burgers and other delicious plates.
1982<>1<>The heavy D devils ale is the best !
1983<>0<>As a craft beer fan who's all-too-willing to support my local brewery, I was surprised that I overlooked having brunch at SanTan Brewing Company.
1984<>0<>It was actually the idea of a friend of mine, a recent transplant to Phoenix from New Orleans, who has taken quite a liking to the East Valley.
1985<>1<>So the gauntlet was thrown down to get some Sunday brunch at SanTan, along with a morning adult beverage.
1986<>1<>I was still dubious after checking the restaurant's website and finding only a lunch/dinner menu, although Sunday hours appeared perfectly congruous with brunch (open at 10 a.m.).
1987<>1<>I'll be damned if I was going to eat a burger for brunch... with brunch I must have eggs!
1988<>0<>It turns out, I had nothing to fear.
1989<>1<>They serve brunch here on Sundays.
1990<>1<>Later fine-tooth-combing of the SanTan website revealed the brunch menu under "events".
1991<>0<>Now for the food...
1992<>1<>I had some very respectable Green Chile Pork Enchiladas (served with EGGS!)
1993<>1<>and my dining companions had the Chilaquiles and the Beer Belly Breakfast burrito.
1994<>1<>All of these dishes featured the jalapeño bratwurst hash that our waiter raved about as his favorite.
1995<>1<>I do think it was a pretty tasty accompaniment to an already yummy plate of food, however, if they ever managed to use Von Hanson's jalapeno cheese brats to make their hash, I would indeed bump them up another star.
1996<>1<>Von Hanson's is a local Chandler meat shop (see my review) that has no equal when it comes to some of their signature sausages.
1997<>1<>Another note: They offer some decent beer cocktails to go with Sunday brunch (although, for the life of me, I cannot find a brunch drink list on their website) including their interpretations of Bloody Mary's and Mimosas.
1998<>1<>My brunching friends were a little underwhelmed with the Bloodies (not spicy enough, in their opinions--but this was somewhat remedied with the waiter's assistance).
1999<>1<>But I was pretty content with my funky mimosa.
2000<>1<>It had a dose of their signature pineapple hefeweizen beer "Mr. Pineapple".
2001<>0<>Aaah... beer for breakfast!
2002<>1<>5 stars all-around.
2003<>1<>The BBQ pork / jalapeno pizza I'm telling you was so darn good.
2004<>1<>The "slingers" are awesome, fried cheese and bacon bit egg rolls with raunch dipping sauce.
2005<>1<>I mean it allowed me to drink like 4 more glasses.
2006<>1<>AWESOME.
2007<>1<>The beers were awesome.
2008<>1<>1 of 3 days I was there I got some warm beer shooters on the sampler paddle, and then they hit me up with a $2.00 surcharge for "gravy" for the enchiladas.
2009<>1<>I mean that is just retarded and I pointed out the half-a-grand we spent with clients over 3 days so they removed the beer sampler.
2010<>1<>So I gotta follow-thru on 5 stars.
2011<>0<>As a former waiter / bartender in college I am real pragmatic.
2012<>1<>And this place makes it obvious why they had a line at 8:30 p.m. Friday and the Pubic House nearby wasn't.
2013<>1<>GREAT WORK.
2014<>1<>Dynamite.
2015<>1<>Great job.
2016<>1<>Impeccable service.
2017<>1<>Really good beer.
2018<>1<>Awesome environment.
2019<>1<>Try the hummus!
2020<>1<>We had a great time here.
2021<>1<>Can't wait to come back!
2022<>0<>I FINALLY was able to visit Roka Akor for the AZ Power Networking lunch.
2023<>1<>What a terrific event.
2024<>1<>The atmosphere was gorgeous, and the staff was very accommodating.
2025<>1<>I have to say that I do not know my sushi.
2026<>1<>Normally, I would not eat a dish without knowing its ingredients, but I was very happy with the samplings provided.
2027<>1<>And a coupon for a free appetizer to boot!
2028<>1<>Wow, there are many in-depth reviews on here so I won't go into detail -- just wanted to give a shout out after my awesome experience here last night.
2029<>1<>I think I may have a new favorite restaurant!
2030<>1<>We came for the Yelp Restaurant Week menu, but ended up spending quite a bit of time in the bar area before our reservation.
2031<>1<>Two rounds of Shochu (HIGHLY recommend the nectarine, so light and clean) and 3 apps later (the butterfish tataki changed my life), we made our way to dinner.
2032<>1<>I have to admit that the apps shined above our entrees (salmon terriyaki), but because we had a limited entree menu with the scorching Yelp deal I am not going to fault Roka Akor for that.
2033<>1<>All-in-all, just a great experience.
2034<>1<>I loved the cool and contemporary atmosphere with all the energy and light -- the vibe is just fantastic.
2035<>1<>I will definitely be returning and will put this in the portfolio as a great place for either business dinners or drink/app dates.
2036<>1<>Instant fan.
2037<>1<>Very noisy and the waiter rushed us to put in order.
2038<>1<>Tempura, greasy.
2039<>1<>Smelled like old oil.
2040<>1<>My cod was a small serving for $28 with no sides, it was adequate that's it.
2041<>1<>They forgot one of our party's order and acted like it took longer to cook, even though it was the same as mine!
2042<>1<>They took that off the bill but that was it.
2043<>1<>Ridiculous really for the money.
2044<>1<>This place is for those that just want to waste money.
2045<>1<>I went there and although the place is classy.
2046<>1<>The portions are small for the high prices they are asking and I just left feeling like I was still hungry.
2047<>1<>I went there with a large group of people and we all had separate tabs but for what you pay I was unsatisfied all together.Nice place and well decorated but I did not pay just for the atmosphere.
2048<>1<>I will go to other places before I come back to Roca Akor which I don't see being anytime soon.
2049<>1<>Thumbs down in my eyes.
2050<>1<>I can't believe it took me so long to get in here - This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service.
2051<>1<>I sat at the bar to watch the chefs at work preparing a variety of impressive sushi and sashimi dishes.
2052<>1<>I tried to start with the oysters - they were out... after that things improved.
2053<>1<>The spicy squid (calamari) comes in a very large portion, the butterfish melted in my mouth, I also thoroughly enjoyed the short ribs and the scallops.
2054<>1<>I will be back to try their much hyped happy hour.
2055<>1<>Hamachi Serrano and the Chirashi roll are outstanding!
2056<>1<>Also, recommend the mini burgers during happy hour.
2057<>1<>In general, the happy hour is excellent here and worth every penny.
2058<>1<>We have dined here many times and each time has been great.
2059<>1<>However, the only issue we have had dining here is with the sashimi being cut poorly.
2060<>1<>Each piece was very tough and we couldn't even chew them.
2061<>1<>Otherwise, everything has always been very good.
2062<>1<>I highly recommend also taking their all you can eat sushi making class if you are looking for something fun to do!
2063<>0<>After reading the reviews for this place, I was really excited to try their food.
2064<>1<>But that was short lived.....
2065<>0<>It was voted one of the top 10 sushi places in the US by Bon Appetite magazine.
2066<>0<>Really?
2067<>0<>I'm not going to say I'm a sushi expert, but I have had some pretty amazing sushi in Chicago, Honolulu, and Vegas.
2068<>1<>Their sushi was nowhere near as awesome as some of the places I've been.
2069<>1<>The place is fancy.
2070<>1<>They did not spare any expense with the decor, with one exception...the fake flowers near the enterence....not something i would pick, but we'll look past that.
2071<>1<>My friend and I order a glass of wine...and then didn't see our server for another 15 minutes.
2072<>0<>We'll look past that too.
2073<>1<>And then the food came.....  We ordered the butterfish and sweet potatoes with some sort of dipping sauce.
2074<>1<>It was middle of the road, not bad, but didn't wow me.
2075<>1<>The sauce they were ranting and raving about wasn't that great (maybe that's why I can't remember the name.....)  We also got the scallop appetizer...also sub-par.
2076<>1<>Then came the rolls.
2077<>1<>We ordered the unagi, special serrano, spicy tuna, spicy avocado, and soft crab rolls.
2078<>1<>The best was probably the serrano.
2079<>1<>The rice was perfectly cooked, I'll give them that.
2080<>1<>The food was just ok, but definitely not worth the price.
2081<>1<>Sure, the place is really nice, and your date would probably be super impressed, but there are plenty of amazing restaurants in the area.
2082<>0<>And Hiro Sushi is just 10 minutes up the road....
2083<>1<>Had the Omakase with the wife.
2084<>1<>Chef is a great guy named Roman from Munich.
2085<>1<>He comes by and asks what you don't like and like.
2086<>1<>There are four courses and each course is about 10 dishes each.
2087<>1<>The Sushi course was outrageous - the freshness unbelievable.
2088<>1<>Only bad - the flavored sochu is pretty gross and overpriced and the dessert was waaaaaay to sour (they replaced it).
2089<>1<>$350 for dinner but worth it for us and hey, my wife doesn't even like Japanese food really!!
2090<>1<>I'm coming back.
2091<>1<>Great food, great service.
2092<>1<>Not the best place for kids, but they had a high chair and they were very accommodating.
2093<>1<>We'll be back for sure.
2094<>1<>We had a fabulous time at Roka Akor on Friday night!
2095<>1<>They saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice.
2096<>0<>We met some friends early for drinks at the bar.
2097<>1<>The service was a bit slow, but it was pretty busy.
2098<>1<>I had a glass of wine, one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend.
2099<>1<>We were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server (wish I could remember her name) who took the time to explain both the Yelp Eats menu, the regular menu and about the restaurant.
2100<>1<>We'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that wasn't part of the Yelp Eats wine special but she honored it anyway.
2101<>1<>From there on out, all I can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food!
2102<>1<>I had the tempura sweet potato and white fish, both were delicious- I am looking forward to going back just for them!
2103<>1<>Next, I had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll, which were some of the best sushi I've had in a while.
2104<>1<>Hubby's pork chop was cooked to perfection, too.
2105<>1<>I can't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere, food, price and service were great.
2106<>1<>Best of all, he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends.
2107<>1<>We will definitely be back!
2108<>1<>I'm a huge fan of Oyshi as it is just minutes from my house.
2109<>1<>There is definitely something to be said about convenience!
2110<>1<>That said, the sushi is pretty damn good here as well.
2111<>1<>Much better than other AYCE (all-you-can-eat) places in town.
2112<>0<>Though I do argue with my friend about what's better between Oyshi and Sushi-mon so I'd call it a coin flip.
2113<>1<>The only reason I didn't give Oyshi 5 starts is because of the service.
2114<>1<>Every once in a while you'll find yourself wanting to order sushi for 10 minutes or more because you haven't seen your server.
2115<>1<>Simple solution for this is to sit at the sushi bar.
2116<>1<>Nothing I would knock it down to 3 stars for because overall is still great sushi and a good experience!
2117<>1<>4.5 stars  Oh sheet, it's oyshi sushi.
2118<>1<>Definitely my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas.
2119<>1<>This is my go to place for sushi with my husband and his co workers  The wait can be long, so get here early.
2120<>1<>The longest we've ever waited is max 20 mins  AYCE for lunch is 21 and dinner is 26 bucks, not bad.
2121<>1<>Which includes a large amount of appetizers and desserts  Favorite rolls: spicy tuna crunch, tiger roll, snow mountains.
2122<>1<>The desserts are delicious.
2123<>1<>The biggest hits being green tea mochi ice cream and the green tea tiramisu.
2124<>1<>The service is excellent, the rolls take a while to come out but it's worth the wait because you can taste the freshness.
2125<>1<>Like all sushi places, they charge you if you waste food.
2126<>1<>One bite or two isn't a big deal but don't waste an entire roll.
2127<>1<>The restaurant looks like a high ended sushi house, that's well decorated.
2128<>1<>Very clean and open.
2129<>1<>Can't wait to take my out of town friends here.
2130<>1<>Very fresh sushi.
2131<>1<>All you can eat for $26 which is a steal for the quality of the sushi here.
2132<>1<>Green tea tiramasui is equally creative and delicious.
2133<>1<>A sure winner for any dinner.
2134<>1<>I'm giving this place 4 stars.
2135<>1<>The rolls are really good and they have a variety of different ones to choose from.
2136<>1<>I think I'm a third done with trying all the different rolls.
2137<>1<>Last time I went they were very pleasant and attentive to our drinks and our rolls came out in a timely fashion.
2138<>0<>(Which I love cause nothing sucks more than having to wait for AYCE.
2139<>1<>You get full faster.)
2140<>1<>This experience varied extremely different over my first visit where it felt like they couldn't wait for us to leave!
2141<>1<>I can happily say that Oyshi has taken up my favorite spot on this side of town.
2142<>1<>It beat Nagoya hands down.
2143<>0<>Living right across the street I had to try this place.
2144<>0<>I had been going to another sushi place down the road but was ready to try something new.
2145<>1<>It is good.
2146<>1<>Not the absolute best for but Vegas sushi it has great selections with very few limitations on the all you can eat menu unlike some of the other places I've been too.
2147<>1<>I have been here many times since my first visit and will continue to go.
2148<>1<>I wished they'd play better music but ohh well, I'll put up with bad techno for good sushi.
2149<>0<>I just prefer my sushi place to be high quality not trendy/techno club wanna be LOL.
2150<>1<>Wow...I didn't realize that I haven't done a review for one of my favorite AYCE sushi joints.
2151<>1<>Anyway...here it is:  Located on the southwest side of town at the corner of Rainbow and Robindale.
2152<>1<>Plenty of parking.
2153<>1<>Customer service is a bit lacking compared to when they first opened but I'm sure it's cause they always have a full house.
2154<>1<>Reasonable price for AYCE at $21.00 for lunch and $26.00 for dinner.
2155<>1<>They have a wide range of menu options which includes appetizers, sashimi/sushi, signature rolls, entrees, kids menu, and my favorite...desserts.
2156<>1<>They also have food options for vegetarians.
2157<>1<>There are private dining areas for a more intimate experience with seating from 5-20+ people.
2158<>1<>The smaller private room seats about 5+ people and has couches for seating and a tv, so while you are dining you can chillax, enjoy your food, and be entertained by the tv.
2159<>1<>The larger room can seat about 20+ so it's ideal for larger parties but there are no couches, just regular seats, however, there is a tv.
2160<>1<>OMG I've been craving this place since the first time.
2161<>1<>It's soo good!
2162<>1<>It was my first time at a sushi bar and I had a wonderful experience.
2163<>1<>We sat at the bar and the chefs make everything in front of you and pass it up when it is ready.
2164<>1<>I tried so much I don't remember everything I tried.
2165<>1<>I remember calamari, salmon, the red rock roll, and green tea tiramisu.
2166<>1<>I remember the red rock roll because it was my favorite.
2167<>1<>The server suggested it and it was delicious.
2168<>1<>I also had the Saki and that was tasty as well ;) By the time we got to the green tea tiramisu I was really full but it was great, I'd definitely get it again.
2169<>1<>Can't wait to go back here!
2170<>0<>!
2171<>1<>I've been coming here since it opened a couple years ago.
2172<>1<>It used to be my spot, but lately they just don't seem to care.
2173<>1<>Last time I was in it took forever for someone to seat us and there were multiple open seats with no one in front of us.
2174<>1<>The service was just plain bad.
2175<>1<>We had multiple servers who couldn't keep my wife's order straight(not a sushi eater) but always loved their Teriyaki Chicken Skewers.
2176<>1<>They either change their teriyaki recipe or screwed up and put something else on it because it wasn't teriyaki.
2177<>1<>Food quality declined.
2178<>1<>The specialty rolls seems to consist of more mayo based sauces than other ingredients.
2179<>1<>Had to go through 3 different people to find the person to give me my check.
2180<>1<>I noticed that many of the guys who I would always see working there in the past weren't there, maybe a coincidence or maybe not.
2181<>1<>By the way Oyshi management-having your employees sleeping one off in the V.I.P.
2182<>1<>lounge in plain sight of customers is just irresponsible and lazy.
2183<>1<>I found Oyshi by accident about 3 years ago an it's been my favorite Sushi spot since then.
2184<>1<>It's definitely the best sushi in Vegas - I always bring my friends so we can try a new roll or just really have a good time.
2185<>1<>I would give them 5, 6, 10 stars a couple years ago but the last time I was there I felt the quality of their food went down!
2186<>1<>The rolls didn't look fresh, the size of the salmon cuts or anything really are half now!
2187<>1<>I got very disappointed when I left the place, It use to be my favorite must go place in Vegas.
2188<>1<>The one good thing about them is I already complained about the service once and they took very good care of me, so I'm assuming if they figure it out the service went down considerably they will definitely take care and made it tool as good as before.
2189<>1<>So disappointed!
2190<>1<>Went to this place for lunch nd felt so uncomfortable.
2191<>1<>I asked to be seated at the bar bc I was alone nd pregnant, so I thought it was good to see how they handle the food beside I expected it to be fun nd fast.
2192<>1<>I did all u can eat.
2193<>1<>Waited 30min for my app: gyoza.
2194<>1<>The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness.
2195<>1<>"I have been always greeted at a bar/sushi bar", it is the least they can do.
2196<>1<>One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place.
2197<>1<>From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 (maniac roll) it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat.
2198<>1<>Everything else was just blah blah blah.
2199<>1<>The service was polite but slow nd confused.
2200<>1<>I never had a refill on my water.
2201<>1<>Their (management/sushi chef) seems like to kiss the good looking/well dressed ppl ass.
2202<>1<>Everyone else were mistreated including myself.
2203<>1<>This was the worse place I have ever been.
2204<>1<>I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect.
2205<>1<>Besides for 1 single good roll???
2206<>1<>Forget it.
2207<>1<>I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service.
2208<>0<>.
2209<>1<>The first roll I had was the monster (every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it.
2210<>1<>every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything.
2211<>1<>My experience at this place lasted around 1 1/2hour bc it would take between 25-35 min for every order.
2212<>1<>Plus 20min for the check.
2213<>1<>In the end I can say: The only good thing about this place is that you can do half order... That's all.
2214<>0<>This may be a superfluous review, as there were lots with high marks already, but I can't resist adding my two cents...  My parents, my husband and I ate here as a celebration for my graduation from my doctoral program back in March.
2215<>0<>We were still on East-coast time, so we ate earlier than many - probably around 6 or so.
2216<>1<>We parked ourselves - which even in high heels wasn't too far.
2217<>1<>There were a few other tables seated ahead of us, but we certainly didn't have to wait to be seated.
2218<>1<>Our server was friendly and polite the whole evening, even as it got quite busy.
2219<>1<>The martini I had was the biggest martini I have ever been served at a restaurant.
2220<>1<>The server brought the shaker over and left it at the table - it was enough to fill two very large martini glasses.
2221<>1<>Woah!
2222<>1<>I am lucky enough to have had many an excellent steak, and the filet at Mastro's was at least as good as the best I've ever had - if not better.
2223<>1<>(And I'm inclined to go with the latter.)
2224<>1<>All the food at the table was delicious, and we all enjoyed our meals tremendously.
2225<>1<>Although, I must say, after two huge martinis, and wine with dinner, I don't remember what anyone had for dessert.
2226<>1<>*blushes*   Anyway,  my experience was absolutely fantastic and I would clearly dine there again if I had the chance.
2227<>1<>This place was packed on a Tuesday night.
2228<>0<>Granted it was during Spring Training, but I don't think they have a problem filling the joint.
2229<>1<>It's got a great atmosphere.
2230<>1<>The bar seemed fun with live music playing and lots of people enjoying themselves.
2231<>1<>The food...
2232<>1<>If you love enormous portion sizes, then this is your place.
2233<>1<>I had the petite fillet and couldn't finish it, which I was very sad about because it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.
2234<>1<>My husband had the bone in fillet, which was terrific as well.
2235<>1<>For sides we just ordered one because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish more than that.
2236<>1<>We had the crab gnocchi, which was great, but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part.
2237<>1<>We didn't have room for dessert.
2238<>1<>Oh, one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you.
2239<>1<>Pretzel bread, olive bread, amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying.
2240<>1<>The service was OK. Definitely some room for improvement.
2241<>1<>Overall though, the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines.
2242<>1<>This place would be great on an expense account.
2243<>1<>Phenomenal dinner with my pops during our vacation to Scottsdale for Spring Training.
2244<>1<>The food isn't cheap, but what good steakhouse is?
2245<>1<>The service was first class from start to finish and I wouldn't hesitate to go again.
2246<>0<>I can't believe I hadn't tried this place until a few weeks ago.
2247<>1<>I'm kicking myself for all the good meals I've missed out on over the years.
2248<>1<>This place is simply AMAZING!
2249<>1<>The service was fantastic, the food was deliciously awesome and the butter cake for dessert, OMG!
2250<>1<>We started with the calamari and seared ahi tuna appetizers and they were excellent.
2251<>1<>For dinner, my husband and I split a filet oscar style and our friend had the regular filet.
2252<>1<>We had sides of creamed spinach, onion rings and au gratin potatoes.
2253<>1<>For dessert we shared the butter cake and the key lime pie.
2254<>1<>I didn't care of the pie, it was too tart for me, but my husband enjoyed it.
2255<>1<>The butter cake is a must!
2256<>1<>We will definitely return and I highly recommend this restaurant.
2257<>1<>If you like steak and mushrooms THiS is the place !
2258<>0<>!
2259<>0<>My husband and I only go on special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays due to the cost.
2260<>1<>But it is sooooo worth it.
2261<>1<>And my favorite part of the meal the butter cake.
2262<>1<>The best dessert I have ever had.
2263<>1<>Save room and big enough for 2 to share!
2264<>1<>The steaks are always good and if your not happy with anything let them know and they will gladly fix it.
2265<>1<>Lobster Mashed potatoes are good but not worth the cost.
2266<>1<>My favorite steakhouse in the valley.
2267<>1<>I typically order the chop salad and Brussels sprouts, with a Gin Martini .
2268<>1<>Service is impeccable, as expected for a high-end steak house.
2269<>1<>Love the service at the bar and you always meet some interesting peeps!
2270<>1<>Got to love North Scottsdale
2271<>1<>I would put this up against the best steak in NY.
2272<>1<>Wolfgang's in NY still gets my top place but Mastro's City Hall is great.
2273<>1<>Incredible steak and sides.
2274<>1<>I had the bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly.
2275<>1<>Great cut of meat.
2276<>1<>Also had a tremendous bowl of delicious lobster mashed potatos.
2277<>1<>Beware of all the butter though...there is plenty of it!
2278<>1<>Entertainment in the lounge area is great too.
2279<>1<>Not your typical lounge singer but a guy playing the guitar along with a pianist will entertain you all night with Top 40 hits in a lounge singer fashion.
2280<>1<>I've been here several times and the food/service is always phenomenal just like all the other Mastro's locations.
2281<>0<>However, on my last trip here last week for my father's 69th birthday, I came to a realization.
2282<>1<>I realized that this location is geared toward younger, club-going people.
2283<>1<>Between the very dim lighting, loudness and type of music playing over the speakers in the main dining area it became clear that this was "Club Mastro's".
2284<>1<>I know the music is meant to quicken the pace of your meal and get you the heck out of there so the next group of suckers can sit, but I don't want to spend that type of money on a dining experience if I am rushed; directly or indirectly.
2285<>1<>Plus I don't like to yell to others at my table and then strain to hear what they are saying.
2286<>0<>Keep in mind was 6:00pm on a Saturday.
2287<>1<>Anyway, I must say again that the food and service were excellent.
2288<>1<>Every bit of food that I put in my mouth from the bread, to the salad, to the steak and sides, to the dessert were all top notch.
2289<>1<>However, at my old age of 31 I think I'm going to stick to the other regular Mastro's locations and dine with the older folk.
2290<>0<>Went again for my 40th birthday last night.
2291<>1<>Again AMAZING.. Our waitress was an older lady with Curley hair and she was HILARIOUS and awesome!
2292<>1<>The food was, awesome as usual.
2293<>1<>Really never had steak this good except the last time I was there!
2294<>1<>The concept of AYCE Sushi is new to me moving here to Vegas.
2295<>1<>At first it sounds too good to be true, followed by a sneaking suspicition of poor quality and limited selection.
2296<>1<>Not at Island Sushi!
2297<>1<>For $20.99 at lunch ($24.95 for dinner), you get a large selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even desserts.
2298<>1<>I mostly avoided the apps (ordered a miso soup and edamame), and stuck with the nigiri.
2299<>1<>The fish was fresh and tasty, and the quality was just as good for the most part of some of the fancier sushi joints I have tried around the country.
2300<>1<>If you come hungry, you definitely get you money's worth without sacrificing quality.
2301<>1<>The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, as its in a strip mall and seating area is just cheap tables and chairs.
2302<>1<>If you want a fancy dining experience, this is not the place.
2303<>1<>I was by myself for lunch and the sushi bar has a small flatscreen TV to watch while I stuffed myself.
2304<>1<>They also do quite a few happy hour type specials on rolls and sake bombs throughout the week if you aren't in the AYCE mood.
2305<>1<>For your non-raw fish eating friends, the other half of the restrauant has a pretty extensive cooked Hawaiian menu.
2306<>1<>However, I don't forsee myself trying that anytime soon.
2307<>1<>The sushi deal here is just too good!
2308<>1<>Just remember to save some room for that 808 Special dessert!
2309<>0<>This was a last minute, drive by decision that fit our timing on a late weekday afternoon.
2310<>1<>What a wonderful surprise!
2311<>1<>Our timing must have been good, cuz we got right in with no wait.
2312<>1<>We got in on the All You Can Eat sushi lunch for 20 bucks.
2313<>1<>The rolls were really good and the staff was super attentive.
2314<>1<>Tiger roll, Mount Charelston roll - thumbs up.
2315<>1<>The spicy scallop?
2316<>1<>Seems to be a different standard out west, and not my favorite Tsu Kasa style.
2317<>1<>The tuna was sublime.
2318<>1<>Seaweed salad - the perfect serving size.
2319<>1<>Shrimp Tempura - amazingly perfect.
2320<>1<>Tried the Ikura (Salmon Roe) but realized I hadn't quite evolved that far.
2321<>1<>I would go back to this place again and again.
2322<>1<>This place has some really good all you can eat sushi-fresh and a good variety to chose from as well!
2323<>1<>After ordering a few things we told the sushi chef what we liked and he gave us a few things to try, he was right on with that and it was very much appreciated!
2324<>1<>Now this was about a week and a half ago and we wanted to try it again!!!
2325<>1<>I had to be at work in 45 minutes so me and my husband decided to met there for a quick bite to eat... My only complaint is that the sushi bar is way to small, there were only about 3 seats left at the bar, 2 were together and one alone.
2326<>1<>Its very close in there and so there was not enough room for us to squeeze in there cause it would not have been comfortable.
2327<>1<>(not to mention my husband has a huge aversion to sitting next to other tables or people at restaurants, if they try to sit us next to another table and there is an open restaurant he freaks out!)
2328<>1<>and we didnt have time to sit at a table and be served so we had to leave!
2329<>1<>We will defiantly be back again, this place is good and the dessert is good too and included (808 dessert was amazing).
2330<>1<>We ended up rushing over to The Ka for a quick bite, always a good place either as a 1st choice (which it usually is for us, but we wanted something new) or as a backup!
2331<>1<>Much better than I thought it would be.
2332<>0<>The door on the left is called Poke Express and we came in that way, but wanted the Sushi restaurant.
2333<>1<>The girl at the counter asked if we wanted a table or sit at the sushi bar, we wanted a table.
2334<>0<>There were long rows of tables that were open, but apparently not available for a party of 2, so the girl said it would be a few minutes wait.
2335<>1<>Then another party of 2 comes in and they get a table right away.
2336<>0<>What?
2337<>1<>They wanted to plug in their ipod so they got a table by the wall.
2338<>1<>We were like, "What?".
2339<>1<>So we just headed right for the susi bar and it was kinda messy.
2340<>1<>The owner came out and cleared the place pretty quickly.
2341<>1<>We started out with some spicy tuna roll and it was really good.
2342<>1<>The tuna looks different from other spicy tuna, but was good never the less.
2343<>1<>The bite size pieces were just perfect on all the rolls.
2344<>1<>They are not too big or not too small, rolled nicely so that they don't fall apart.
2345<>1<>The All you can eat at dinner is $25 for 90 minutes so I am sure some diners can do quite a bit of damage here for that price and time limit.
2346<>0<>We did a good job, but finished in less than a hour.
2347<>1<>Overall it was a nice place an we will be back for more sushi.
2348<>1<>The "Poke Express" side on the left has some nice looking noodle bowls and we want to try some saimin soon.
2349<>1<>This place has potential and we'll be back to try more "Aloha" food.
2350<>1<>Good job except our entrance experience.
2351<>1<>I came here again a few weeks ago, and was a little disappointed the food didn't live up to my memory.
2352<>1<>The first time I came, this WAS THE BEST SUSHI ROLLS I ever had.
2353<>1<>Now, it's really good, but the rolls didn't pop.
2354<>1<>The sushi didn't seem as fresh and vigorous as before, and the presentation was also a little bit underwhelming.
2355<>1<>Still, very good sushi and I would eat here again if in the area;  Probably won't make a 200 mile detour trip like I did this last time though.
2356<>1<>I absolutely love Island Sushi for their garlic chicken, fried noodles, spam katsu musubi (it's so.... ono!
2357<>1<>Katsu breading around the spam!
2358<>1<>), creme puffs, malasadas, and the list goes on and on and on.
2359<>0<>I moved away from Hawaii 6 years ago so this is a great place to eat in between my trips back home.
2360<>1<>I would come here more often if I didn't live on the opposite side of town.
2361<>1<>:) I normally just order to go but I've been here once for AYCE and that was pretty good.
2362<>1<>They also added the option to order online too!
2363<>1<>It's great because you can specify whether or not you want mac salad, all rice, etc.
2364<>1<>Then you can specify the time you want the pick up and you can also pay online.
2365<>1<>So easy!
2366<>1<>All I have to say now is, get over here and try it.
2367<>1<>Even if you are not from Hawaii, you will love the food!
2368<>1<>Don't be afraid to try anything and everything!
2369<>1<>Island Sushi - Thank you for always providing great food and excellent customer service!
2370<>1<>Great place to get a Hawaiian fix.
2371<>1<>They have all the favorites even Haupui, Dobosh cake, Poke.
2372<>1<>I tried the Poke and it was very good.
2373<>1<>The Yakisoba was OK, wonton Ramen was delicious, and kimchi ramen was good too, but just a tad too spicy for my taste.
2374<>1<>Also tried the loco moco it was good, but not the best I've had.
2375<>1<>Have to go back to try the Oxtail soup after 6:00pm.
2376<>1<>I found this place doing a Yelp search while planning my trip to LV.
2377<>1<>And the lovely thing was my cousin and LV resident, highly recommended this place for AYCE sushi.
2378<>1<>The great thing about this place (to me) is that it's away from the LV Strip.
2379<>0<>Been there, done that, y'know?
2380<>1<>Sometimes off the beaten track is best and Island Sushi did not disappoint!
2381<>1<>This place is a hole-in-the-wall.
2382<>0<>No doubt about that.
2383<>1<>You want a Zen or tranquil or a sleek sushi house experience, this ain't it.
2384<>1<>This is get-down-to-business-eat-your-sushi-or-Hawaiian-favorites kinda joint.
2385<>1<>We had a fantastic experience.
2386<>1<>The servers were great.
2387<>1<>Always checking on us, clearing plates, refilling glasses and making sure if we wanted more sushi--and not in a "hurry up and order" kind of way, but in a genuine "would you like more to eat?"
2388<>0<>kind of way.
2389<>1<>This was my first time doing AYCE sushi (other than Todai which I hated, so I won't count that).
2390<>1<>We made sure we understood the rules and then we ordered well.
2391<>1<>Very well.
2392<>1<>Everything was delicious.
2393<>1<>Well made and fresh.
2394<>1<>We ordered Ahi Poke and Hammachi Kama.
2395<>1<>The Ahi Poke was my favorite--the flavors so fresh.
2396<>1<>I wish I could re-create it at home because I'd eat it at least once a week.
2397<>1<>The Hammachi was delicious too.
2398<>1<>It reminded me of the grilled fish my dad serves.
2399<>1<>Nigiri: Tuna, Cajun Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore, Hammachi, Salmon, Ebi and Unagi.
2400<>1<>Some we loved so much we ordered them twice (and 3 times in the case of Garlic Tuna)    Maki: Tiger, Spicy Mexican, Joe's Special.
2401<>1<>All so good.
2402<>1<>If you like Jalapeno and Siracha, the Mexican roll is for you.
2403<>1<>For me, it had a nice heat, not too spicy.
2404<>1<>The Tiger Roll was my favorite because I love shrimp tempura and spicy tuna--well made and tasty.
2405<>1<>Joe's Special--I don't know who Joe is, but this is also a fine roll--shrimp tempura, cucumber and ahi.
2406<>1<>Save room for dessert.
2407<>1<>In fact, if you're full, order dessert anyway.
2408<>1<>They're not huge portions but are certainly delicious.
2409<>1<>I had the Malassada sundae, made with warm malassada donuts, vanilla ice cream, strawberries and guava sauce drizzle.
2410<>1<>Every bite was delicious.
2411<>1<>I also got to try the warm brownie sundae--also very good.
2412<>1<>The brownie is dense and rich, almost like a flourless chocolate cake.
2413<>1<>The bro is good at math so I had him check our AYCE price versus if we just paid a la carte--the AYCE is definitely a steal.
2414<>1<>This is certainly better than any buffet style AYCE sushi because you can order off of 3 different pages of Nigiri and Maki and side dishes and everything is fresh to order.
2415<>0<>I didn't know what to really expect when I came here, but I saw a picture of saimin the day before and I knew that I just had to go!
2416<>0<>I got here a lil before 11 am and it was pretty packed.
2417<>1<>I ordered the deluxe saimin and subbed it out with udon noodles instead.
2418<>1<>Everything came out fairly quickly.
2419<>1<>Broth was light and there was a good assortment of wonton, bbq pork and imitation crab meat.
2420<>1<>I didn't leave full though, so that was the downfall.
2421<>1<>My coworker enjoyed the teriyaki chicken which he ate all of.
2422<>1<>I know I will be back to get some chantilly cake to go!
2423<>1<>They have a pastry selection that looked pretty delish, but can be pricy at $4.50 a slice.
2424<>1<>We were in and out in 30 minutes and everyone was quite friendly.
2425<>1<>the service was good.
2426<>1<>the sushi was ok, the rice fell apart when i picked it up.
2427<>1<>the fish tasted fresh and they had a spicy roll which i loved.
2428<>1<>it was spicy crunchy!
2429<>1<>with sriracha, green pepper, crunchies and shrimp tempura.
2430<>1<>we also tried the deep fried chicken from the other room.
2431<>1<>that was super delish.
2432<>1<>and i had dessert of course.
2433<>1<>dabash cake which was chocolate on chocolate.
2434<>1<>the dessert was made at their bakery and made up for the rice.
2435<>1<>it's a family restaurant and so it was loud.
2436<>1<>they also offered half off rolls!
2437<>1<>I have to jump off the Over Easy bandwagon unfortunately.
2438<>1<>I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service.
2439<>0<>I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.
2440<>0<>I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service.
2441<>1<>Today my friend and I received neither.
2442<>1<>Upon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8.
2443<>1<>We were "greeted" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.
2444<>1<>I stated we were not but drinks would be great.
2445<>1<>We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine).
2446<>1<>After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.
2447<>1<>The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.
2448<>1<>She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner.
2449<>1<>The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.
2450<>1<>After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.
2451<>1<>I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way.
2452<>1<>After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food.
2453<>1<>The food itself was good, but not great in any way.
2454<>1<>Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.
2455<>1<>After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent.
2456<>1<>After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more.
2457<>1<>After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20.
2458<>1<>I feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.
2459<>1<>I will no longer eat there.
2460<>1<>i just returned from Over Easy and I'm a fan.
2461<>1<>The man (referred to by other reviewers) who runs the place was very courteous and not only did he help us get seated, he also checked on us during our meal and made a point to say goodbye when we left.
2462<>1<>(and it's Sunday Morning)  Food I had their mushroom,cheddar, and scallions Omlette and it was delicious!
2463<>1<>They use the 'standard' mushroom and 2 other varieties I couldn't identify *the identification issue is on my part, not theirs :)  The omlette was cooked perfectly and was big enough for 2 people to split.
2464<>1<>The Coffee was good for breakfast shop coffee.
2465<>1<>Not burned or weak..
2466<>1<>I even got a cup to go.
2467<>1<>So, to the 2 start haters out there I say: "Lighten up, and enjoy life Over Easy".
2468<>1<>This is one of the best breakfast places in the Valley.
2469<>1<>The food is out of this world and the service is great.
2470<>0<>We showed up at 1:00 PM on the 4th of July.
2471<>1<>They close at 1:00 but they seated us anyway.
2472<>0<>I had met the owner over eighteen months ago.
2473<>0<>He remembered my name.
2474<>1<>The hash browns can't be beat.
2475<>1<>They are grilled to perfection on the outside.
2476<>1<>The chicken fried steak is smothered with sausage and bacon gravy.
2477<>1<>I would review the other food but I keep coming back for the chicken fried steak.
2478<>0<>Gotta try something else one day.
2479<>0<>Went here with a friend on a Sunday morning, thinking that it would be packed and there wouldn't be a chance of getting in.
2480<>0<>We were wrong!
2481<>1<>My friend was late and I had to sit for a while, but the gentleman taking names brought me a glass of water while I waited.
2482<>1<>So nice!
2483<>1<>Food was decent and quick.
2484<>1<>I had the egg white omelet with asparagus, tater tots, and a side of bacon.
2485<>1<>All were delish, though the omelet's asparagus was too greasy, probably cooked on the griddle.
2486<>1<>My friend had the French toast, which wasn't anything to write home about but fine.
2487<>1<>My coffee was way too strong (and I typically love strong coffee) but I was happy they had milk to put in it instead of cream.
2488<>1<>I had to ask for refills, though.
2489<>1<>But water glasses were filled promptly.
2490<>1<>We sat outside and were pretty cool under the misters but eventually got uncomfortable.
2491<>1<>Overall, Over Easy is a nice place to go if you don't feel like going to a Denny's-ish kind of place.
2492<>1<>The tater tots are awesome and the prices are good.
2493<>1<>It's not the best brunch EVAR but it's certainly one I'd have again.
2494<>1<>Really liked this place!
2495<>1<>The only downside was the wait which they really cannot help because it is a bit small but you have to take that into consideration that stopping in is a risk if you do not want to wait.
2496<>1<>The staff is very friendly and I too loved the waffle and chicken with the hot sauce and maple syrup.
2497<>1<>Sounded bad but tasted awesome.
2498<>1<>They were really quick to warm up our coffee and the service remained top notch.
2499<>1<>many different items on the menu so I will be back to try more.
2500<>0<>Ehhhh...
2501<>1<>I'm underwhelmed...  On a scale of 1-10...
2502<>1<>I give it a C...  Because that is how much sense it makes to not make an amazing scrabbled egg.....
2503<>1<>Tried this place twice......  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.....
2504<>1<>We must have been there at a bad time.
2505<>1<>I've had breakfast here before and it was great.
2506<>0<>Today?
2507<>0<>Not so much.
2508<>1<>I ordered the caramelized banana and pecan french toast, one of the items that Over Easy is known for, with a side order of bacon and coffee to drink.
2509<>1<>The coffee was excellent.
2510<>1<>That's the good news.
2511<>1<>The bacon was way overcooked and I did mention it to the wait staff (she took it off our bill).
2512<>1<>The bananas were more like plantains, almost crunchy and not to my liking.
2513<>1<>The sauce didn't quite hit the right amount of sweetness; it fell ever so short of delicious.
2514<>1<>The bread itself was very good and I would try regular french toast there again.
2515<>1<>My dining mate's eggs were ordered over medium and they arrived over easy.
2516<>1<>She did, though, request a substitution of sausage patties and they accommodated her without a second thought.
2517<>1<>Her English muffin was perfectly toasted and her dessert of English muffin, jelly, and sausage was amazing.
2518<>1<>Overall, my first visit to Over Easy a couple years ago was much more satisfying than this one, so I will try them again.
2519<>1<>Our server was fine and met our requests with a smile.
2520<>1<>They were not very busy when we were there and that may be the reason for overdone bacon, but the bananas were definitely "off."
2521<>1<>So I really wanted to like this place.. it's cute, super-packed, and had some good looking and original menu items.
2522<>1<>It was just too busy and service was not as good as I hoped.
2523<>1<>I didn't get a coffee refill until I asked for the check.
2524<>1<>I ordered the Wolf Pack, which is two eggs sandwhiched between hashbrowns with bacon and cheese.
2525<>1<>My hashbrowns were a little undercooked, and I really don't like soggy hashbrowns.
2526<>1<>Other than that, it was delicious though.
2527<>1<>My friend ordered the brioched french toast.
2528<>1<>When she asked our waitress what 'brioched' meant, the waitress told us it was just normal french toast... that really did not impress me.
2529<>1<>My friend said it was absolutely delicious though, some of the best french toast she's ever had.
2530<>1<>I'll try this place again, since it's so close to home,  and its possible I just visited on an off day.
2531<>1<>It's a tad dissapointing after visiting valley greats like Matt's Big Breakfast.
2532<>0<>Over-easy could be Arcadia's version of Matt's, with some work.
2533<>1<>Plan on waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, as this place is PACKED.
2534<>1<>I went there at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and it was totally full and there was already a wait!
2535<>0<>Went here for breakfast today after seeing on the food network last night.
2536<>1<>The wait wasn't bad for a Sunday morning - about 10 minutes.
2537<>1<>I have to say that it was elbow to elbow seating as some have suggested.
2538<>1<>It was comfortable.
2539<>1<>We ordered three different things.
2540<>1<>1. an omelete - which was no better or no worse than anywhere else - although the has browns were way overdone/overcooked.
2541<>1<>1. breakfast burrito - this was actually pretty good.
2542<>1<>3. their touted brioche carmelized french toast...This came out cold and if you're expecting anything like they present on TV, you'll be very disappointed.
2543<>1<>The carmel sauce was just a drizzle at the bottom of the dish, the bananas were just 4 of the smallest little banana circles i've ever seen and the pecans where just a spinkle of nut crumbs you'd find at the bottom of the jar of nuts.
2544<>1<>It didn't have a bad taste, just underwhelming if you expected what was advertised on TV...All in all, not a bad place for breakfast,but nothing to go out of the way for..
2545<>1<>Not bad,  but not amazing either.
2546<>1<>The Eggs Benedict Florentine had nicely blanched fresh spinach,  but something about the houlindese sauce is off.
2547<>1<>Maybe the lemon or the lack of zing in the flavor.
2548<>1<>A group of 10 of us came here for a friend's birthday and we were treated with exceptional service.
2549<>1<>The service here is definitely not lacking and not an issue whatsoever.
2550<>1<>They ran out of braised short ribs even though we had dinner reservations super early before the restaurant even got remotely packed.
2551<>1<>This was really disappointing to the group of us that ordered the dish.
2552<>1<>I thought the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare was just A-OK, but nothing special.
2553<>1<>The dish came with plenty of seafood, which was great, but the pasta was just too hard for my taste.
2554<>1<>My boyfriend absolutely loved the beef cheek ravioli.
2555<>1<>It is one of their specials, so don't except to find it on their menu.
2556<>1<>The mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes were AMAZING!
2557<>1<>Definitely recommend it and the desserts were all yummy.
2558<>1<>Can't really go wrong with any of them.
2559<>1<>Overall...I thought dinner was A-OK, but I won't go out of my way to come back.
2560<>1<>If you love steak or meat, this is the place to go.
2561<>1<>My husband I and I just had the most amazing dinner here last night.
2562<>1<>Both got steak and practically didn't even need a knife to cut it.
2563<>1<>The wine, salads and sides we ordered were outstanding!
2564<>1<>PLEASE NOTE: your bill will be on the higher end...and even though we hardly EVER do something like this...you get what you pay for.
2565<>1<>Superior service, fantastic environment and outstanding food!
2566<>1<>Great place to take a date or impress someone:)
2567<>1<>STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE  One statement...we got sick eating here.
2568<>1<>We ordered 3 of their "top" choices for steaks including their "signature 9 month dry aged" steak, and ended up getting sick.
2569<>1<>While that is enough to earn one star, how they handled the issue is even worse.
2570<>1<>When I approached the restaurant to inform them that their food caused my entire party to get sick, they appeared to show genuine concern and said they would report the incident and have someone contact me.
2571<>1<>ONE MONTH LATER, I finally get in touch with their LIABILITIES department who informs me that they do not see anything was done wrong so nothing will be done.
2572<>1<>Upon retrospect, they do this to MAKE YOU GO AWAY.
2573<>1<>So...to all Yelpers...take their advice and STAY AWAY.
2574<>1<>We blew well over a grand at this place and for what....sickness, poor customer service, and severe disappointment.
2575<>1<>Save yourself the trouble...
2576<>1<>I HIGHLY do not recommend your money at this place because it is a waste of money.
2577<>1<>The food is undercooked and is OVERLY over priced.
2578<>1<>It's my first time here, and I will wouldn't recommend to come here.
2579<>0<>But everybody had their own opinion.
2580<>1<>possibly 4.5 stars.
2581<>1<>extremely enjoyable experience all around.
2582<>1<>fresh shaved truffle galore..
2583<>1<>I am a true believer in Mario Batalio after visiting both B&B and most recently CarneVino.
2584<>1<>Had a great business dinner for 20 at CarneVino this past week.
2585<>1<>Great food, great service.
2586<>1<>This place has been refined by Mario and Joe.
2587<>1<>A++
2588<>1<>High price, but out of all the upscale spots I've eaten at, this one actually seems worth the price.
2589<>1<>Food quality / service... satisfied.
2590<>1<>In the top three steak joints I've ever been to.
2591<>1<>Our Conceirge at the Wynn hotel suggest this place so we had high hopes but were a bit disappointed afterwards.
2592<>1<>Maybe because we love Chef Batali so we had higher expectations?
2593<>0<>We've had better steaks in Las Vegas.
2594<>1<>Delmonico for one is made my steak better.
2595<>1<>I don't really see or taste anything special in this steak.
2596<>1<>Side portions are pretty small  We love chef Batali, just not this restaurant
2597<>0<>I'm surprised Yelpers don't seem to like this place as much.
2598<>0<>I'll give the good news and bad news, bad news first.
2599<>1<>The sides are definitely small.
2600<>1<>While the presentation of the mashed potatoes is cool (they crack the egg in front of you and mix it in), it's over-hyped.
2601<>1<>If you have a large group, you might as well order pasta entrees to be your sides.
2602<>1<>On the other hand, the dry aged rib-eye steak was amazing.
2603<>1<>Worth splurging.
2604<>1<>You would think for the price you pay here, you would get at the very least good, decent service.
2605<>1<>Took the groom and the groomsmen to this fancy place trying to have a memorable experience.
2606<>1<>Bad decision!
2607<>1<>Waiter was slow, service was slow, food was slow.
2608<>1<>When I tried to complain to the Manager on duty, Tyler, he didn't even have the decency to look like he was even interested in what I had to say.
2609<>1<>I'm not typically the type to complain, I'm quite easy going when it comes to restaurant services, but the horrible service and bad experience we were having prompted me to talk to the manager.
2610<>1<>On top of the bad service, the steaks were NOT THAT GREAT!
2611<>1<>I've had better elsewhere...  You are essentially paying for crap service and crap food if you go here...AVOID.
2612<>1<>I love this place.
2613<>1<>Great happy hour drinks and food.
2614<>0<>Last night was my 3rd visit.
2615<>0<>Went and saw Sex in The City 2 and after we brought our ticket stub in and had free open bar for an hour!!!
2616<>1<>It is usually very crowded and loud but thats to be expected with a good club.
2617<>1<>Great place to take visitors b4 hitting the major clubs.
2618<>1<>Seems like every time we attempt to go here, we end up at Yard House way more satisfied.
2619<>1<>We were once denied admittance where a friend had a birthday party of a large group because we had shorts on.
2620<>0<>(Why would anyone wear long pants in the southern Nevada summer   where the temperature reaches 115 degrees?)
2621<>1<>Another attempt to come here with another couple they wanted to let our wife's in and charge my friend and I $20.00 each.
2622<>1<>There are plenty of other places where  locals can spend money in this town, not to mention without the threat of being shot by some failure in  life gang member (witch has happend at this very place.)
2623<>1<>They will never get our busness, FACT!
2624<>1<>This is a great place if you are not looking to go to a club but want good music, good drinks and want to smoke some hookah!
2625<>1<>Service is always on top of their game!
2626<>1<>They see a drink low, they come ask if you want more and they deliver fast!
2627<>1<>They are a little overpriced and the drinks arent that strong, but thats usually the case for anyplace you go.
2628<>1<>They have an outdoor bar and an indoor bar.
2629<>1<>If you are indoor, sometimes you are lucky enough to get to see live music!
2630<>1<>They had a great band that played some awesome tunes.
2631<>1<>The hookah is $30, I think that is a little over priced, I usually you only pay about $20.
2632<>0<>I am either not hip enough for this place or I am too hip.
2633<>0<>Not sure.
2634<>1<>The guys here look like they are really trying to be cooler than everyone, but instead, they just look like tools that are trying too hard.
2635<>0<>SUIT UP!!!!!
2636<>1<>You really look like you have shafts shoved up your......Apparently, I am NOT that impressed with myself to belong here.
2637<>1<>$13 for baked Brie en croute' and $15 for 5 shrimps in a shrimp martini?
2638<>1<>Could have gone to Firefly and had more, with a better atmosphere.
2639<>1<>The band, Acoustic Soul, is good.
2640<>1<>Of course, all instruments are amplified, so I guess they are using the name, ironically.
2641<>1<>The sound mixer must have had too many beers or the ears are shot, because the mix is over modulated.
2642<>1<>It would be nice to hear the singer, he really does have a good timbre.
2643<>1<>I was at the Blue Martini with 50 of my closest friends on Sunday November 17, 2013.
2644<>1<>We had a great time we were there for an Anniversary celebration and yes 50 guys showed up.
2645<>1<>The waitresses did a GREAT job as the orders The band was outstanding.
2646<>1<>105.7 the Oasis was also in the house.
2647<>1<>So if you looking for something on a Sunday night try it.
2648<>1<>You can also check out the games on the many TV they have.
2649<>1<>Food is good and happy hour prices are great!
2650<>1<>I live their martini options, and a plus is their half off drink from 3-7 for happy hour !!'
2651<>1<>I ordered my second Grey Goose  Vodka martini....clearly it was the WELL vodka....when I brought it to their attn, they treated me like I was a rookie vokda drinker....I have been drinking good vodka longer than Jen, the bartender has been alive....nice sassy additude Jen....sub-par service .......again!
2652<>0<>Next time, I will not let clients choose the location!
2653<>1<>A group of friends and I go pretty regularly to their Sunday happy hour (4-8pm) after catching a movie at Rave.
2654<>1<>I'm not an "industry" worker so I don't get those discounts.
2655<>1<>They do give a free drink with a movie stub from Rave though - not many people seem to know this.
2656<>1<>Personally I wouldn't go here without my free drink and happy hour prices.
2657<>1<>The drinks are ok but not worth $14 a pop.
2658<>1<>The food used to be really good but then they "upgraded" the menu.
2659<>1<>Apparently it didn't occur to them that some people don't like seafood as 60%+ of the menu contains seafood.
2660<>1<>They also removed the best items on the menu for things I have yet to see anyone in our group order.
2661<>1<>The food is barely worth it at happy hour prices and I would never pay full price for any of it.
2662<>1<>The service is hit or miss - some waitresses are fantastic (Christine, if she's even still there) and others are horrid.
2663<>1<>I had one waitress slam my ticket on the table and yell "IT WAS THE BARTENDERS FAULT!"
2664<>1<>after having to ask for my bill 4 times over a 45 minute time span.
2665<>1<>I should have just walked out.
2666<>1<>Like I said - you can tolerate it at happy hour prices, but otherwise, there are 4-5 other places to go in TS where you'll get better food and service at full price.
2667<>1<>Awesome place for locals to come out and chill.
2668<>1<>They always have specials for locals in industry nights, and the they play every type of music.
2669<>1<>I like it!
2670<>1<>Happy Hour martinis, appetizers, and great service?
2671<>1<>If these three appeal to you, the Blue Martini is the place to be from 4-8pm.
2672<>1<>With half off beverages and up to 50% of off food, you will be enjoying an evening in a great atmosphere with lively waiters.
2673<>1<>The setting of the restaurant/bar is also a plus since the outside bar has a cabana feel and in the inside has a club feel.
2674<>1<>(if you get the blue martini which comes with a small glowstick, you will be ready to light up the dance floor!).
2675<>1<>As far as the food goes, I suggest the seared ahi tuna platter.
2676<>1<>This comes with a delicious and refreshing seaweed salad paired with some freshly grated ginger and wasabi.
2677<>1<>The shrimp and crab dish is also a must order.
2678<>1<>It comes with toasted crostini bread points.
2679<>1<>Very disappointed, the food was not at all what I expected, tasteless and small portions.
2680<>1<>Service was just ok.. not the best.
2681<>1<>I do not recommend eating here especially when there are so many great choices in Vegas.
2682<>1<>All in all, pretty disappointed.
2683<>1<>Service started off very slow and the place was 1/2 empty.
2684<>1<>Took 20 minutes to nail down a drink and a piece of bread.
2685<>1<>The candied bacon was a great novelty and I would recommend it.
2686<>1<>Beet salad was light and fresh.... not off the hook, but good.
2687<>1<>Loved the pistachios.
2688<>1<>Butternut squash lacked flavor and was rather doughy.
2689<>1<>Short Ribs were very good with a nice sauce and what appeared to be a sweet potato purée.
2690<>1<>The salmon with couscous was bland and undercooked.
2691<>1<>Trust me, we love sashimi and sushi.
2692<>1<>The entire dish lacked any flavor.
2693<>1<>My wife ate about a fourth of it.
2694<>1<>Believing that a restaurant can only improve if you are honest when they ask you how the food is, we let our server know when she asked.
2695<>1<>She offered to bring something else, we declined.
2696<>1<>Taking it off of the bill would have been the right move.
2697<>1<>The puff pastry filled with white chocolate and a wonderful dipping sauce, was great.
2698<>1<>All in all, come here for the bacon and the desert.
2699<>1<>I think these celebrity chefs open too many restaurants and they lose control over the quality.
2700<>0<>BAM!
2701<>1<>Once here was enough.
2702<>0<>Recently tried Table 10.
2703<>1<>Pretty good!
2704<>1<>I have been to several of Emeril's Restaurants and this one is worthy of bearing his name.
2705<>0<>I've even been lucky enough to have him fix me something special when he was at Commander's Palace.
2706<>1<>That was a treat.
2707<>0<>Back to Table 10.
2708<>1<>Walking in, I felt like I was back in N'awlins.
2709<>1<>The decor is clean, classy and welcoming.
2710<>1<>Service is spectacular!
2711<>1<>Attentive, polite, knowledgable, friendly.
2712<>1<>It doesn't get much better.
2713<>1<>On to the food.
2714<>1<>Roasted Beef Marrow Bones were decadent, luxurious, mouth watering.
2715<>1<>Perfection.
2716<>1<>Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo was awesome!
2717<>1<>An authentic Big Easy soup.
2718<>1<>Emeril's NOLA BBQ Shrimp were okay.
2719<>1<>A bit over cooked.
2720<>1<>Croque Madame was fantastic.
2721<>1<>Flavorful ham, eggs cooked perfectly.
2722<>1<>No brown edges, yolks thick and rich.
2723<>1<>So good... My mouth is watering.
2724<>1<>Pork PoBoy was really tender, juicy, flavorful.
2725<>1<>Truffle Mac N Cheese was really good.
2726<>1<>A bit watery, but that didn't stop me!
2727<>1<>My biggest thrill was the fact they serve Abita Beer and had Crystal Hot Sauce!!!!
2728<>1<>Only thing missing was Bread Pudding.
2729<>1<>Com'on Emeril, It's a New Orleans based restaurant.
2730<>1<>Where  da bread puddin at?
2731<>1<>If they would have had it, five stars.
2732<>1<>This place was pretty empty but we were dining on a Sunday night.. We made a reservation on opentable and got there in 15 min !
2733<>1<>Since the main entrees were a little pricey, we opted to share some of the appetizers so that we could get a better taste of more dishes... for the 2 of us, we ended up ordering the gumbo, crab salad, margharita pizza, lobster Mac n cheese and BBQ ribs.
2734<>1<>My favorite was the Mac and cheese cooked to just the best temperature, cheesy heaven more lobster would have been good but overall satisfying!
2735<>1<>The ribs with pickled corn was also very good!
2736<>1<>Not too fatty or oily meat fell off the bone easily.
2737<>1<>Thecrab sale was also very fresh although it wasn't tossed well because some parts were extra salty.
2738<>1<>The gumbo was ok had much better elsewhere..
2739<>1<>The pizza was the worst, it was jusT WAY too oily, it was drenched in oil and the cheese was just barely melted, not browned.
2740<>1<>it was so oily i could only take a few bites :( wouldn't get that again .
2741<>1<>The service was fine, ambience was great.
2742<>1<>Ncie and quiet.
2743<>1<>Did dinner with a friend at Table 10 last night and overall had an OK (only) experience.
2744<>1<>The waitstaff was mostly attentive-but at times disappeared as well.
2745<>1<>One app came out over cooked, and they did return it and bring out a re-fired one quickly and without attitude.
2746<>1<>Both of us also had the signature gumbo-and while the flavor profile was right, as Emeril himself would say-it needed to be kicked up a couple of notches.
2747<>1<>Overall, it was bland.
2748<>1<>The signature banana cream pie was huge and good, the bananas foster was served de-construcred and the flavors never really came together.
2749<>1<>Overall-the food and service were OK, but you would expect more from Emeril's place.
2750<>1<>This place was dead when we arrived.
2751<>1<>Nothing changed in the 2 hours or so that we were there.
2752<>1<>We had the tasting menu and it was good but not great.
2753<>1<>The service was good but slow beyond words.
2754<>1<>We asked to pack our dessert and take it back to the room because we were getting tired of sitting there for so long.
2755<>1<>With so many culinary options in Vegas, Table 10 needs to step up it's game!
2756<>1<>I gave another of Emeril's restaurant a try.
2757<>1<>The only memorable thing about my visit here was the lobster mac-n-cheese.
2758<>1<>Other than that, I wouldn't return.
2759<>1<>Some of the food was bland and others were overly salty.
2760<>1<>I will pass on this place!!!
2761<>0<>!
2762<>0<>BAM!
2763<>0<>Emeril is a winner!
2764<>1<>Food and service are great.
2765<>0<>We didn't have anything we didn't enjoy.
2766<>0<>*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***  Table 10 only offers a lunch option during Restaurant Week but this is a good way to try a place.
2767<>1<>For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.
2768<>1<>This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.
2769<>1<>The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.
2770<>1<>When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.
2771<>1<>I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at Joël Robuchon.
2772<>1<>As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.
2773<>1<>The spice was there.
2774<>1<>It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.
2775<>1<>For the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.
2776<>1<>This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.
2777<>1<>It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.
2778<>1<>For dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.
2779<>1<>I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.
2780<>1<>It was excellent.
2781<>1<>A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.
2782<>1<>It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.
2783<>1<>It was excellent!
2784<>1<>Service was good.
2785<>1<>There weren't a whole lot of people here, but it appeared like one server was covering the lunch crowd except for the people sitting at the bar.
2786<>1<>A solid Restaurant Week selection!
2787<>1<>For the reviewer who said with the presence of in n out, she probably shouldn't have come to table 10 in the first place!
2788<>1<>When you're in Vegas, be prepared to fork out a couple extra bucks for good food.
2789<>1<>Table 10 is a unique style.
2790<>1<>It's supposed to be somewhat of a fine-dining place, hence the location in the Palazzo Hotel in the shoppes, but at the same time it's supposed to be casual dining as well.
2791<>1<>The prices aren't as high as Emril's other fine dining places such as Delmonico's but of course not as low as fast food like in n out.
2792<>1<>*chuckles*  After my friends went to go see Jersey Boys, we met them up here for dinner around 9:45.
2793<>0<>The close at 10 but the gladly welcomed us in.
2794<>1<>First the bread came out and the rolls were warm and soft!
2795<>1<>Very yummy!
2796<>1<>We started off with the calamari which was pretty good but I've had better.
2797<>1<>The parsley lemon aioli was  pretty tasty.
2798<>1<>We also got to sample the tuna tartar since they heard it was my friend's 25th birthday!
2799<>1<>That was really good too!
2800<>1<>My boyfriend and I shared the duck which was marinated in coca cola for 4 days and after it was prepared and it created a nice glaze that made the skin so crispy!
2801<>1<>It was by far the best duck I've had!!
2802<>1<>The portion was so much that my boyfriend and I had split that dish and we both didn't finish!
2803<>1<>As for sides, we got the baked truffle mac and cheese!
2804<>1<>Delicious!
2805<>1<>The mashed potato!
2806<>1<>The best also that I've ever had!
2807<>1<>So creamy!
2808<>1<>The frites - this I can totally pass on!!
2809<>1<>The lychee martini supposedly was super good!
2810<>1<>The birthday girl got it and her and her boyfriend absolutely loved it!
2811<>1<>I would definitely come here again!
2812<>1<>The food was great and so was the service!
2813<>1<>This place is what happens when God makes a steak house!!!
2814<>1<>Seriously, It's restaurants like these that keep me from turning vegetarian.
2815<>0<>I went here as part of my boys bachelor party.
2816<>1<>Let me start with the dinning environment:  Very clean with a slight industrial feel.
2817<>1<>The swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.
2818<>1<>It also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.
2819<>1<>Trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.
2820<>1<>Appetizers:  Bone Marrow Flan, Kobe Sashimi, and Maple Glazed Pork Belly.
2821<>1<>ALL ON POINT~!!!
2822<>1<>The bone marrow flan was so rich and buttery.
2823<>1<>It literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.
2824<>1<>The Kobe sashimi was fresh and light.
2825<>1<>The beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.
2826<>1<>This is a must try.
2827<>1<>And then came the maple glazed pork belly.
2828<>1<>Sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....  Sides:  Creamed Spinach and roasted potatoes.
2829<>1<>Let me preface by saying...
2830<>1<>I am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.
2831<>1<>So to me, this dish was bound for failure.
2832<>1<>The spinach was topped with a fried egg that was mixed in table-side and served to us.
2833<>1<>The rest of my table loved it.
2834<>1<>I was not a big fan.
2835<>1<>No slight to the chef... just personal preference.
2836<>1<>It was good, but not my cup of tea.
2837<>1<>The potatoes however were great!
2838<>1<>Roasted simply with some onions and garlic.
2839<>1<>Sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.
2840<>1<>And this side was a prime example of that.
2841<>1<>Main: American Wagyu New York Steak If you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.
2842<>1<>You shell out the money and get the best that they offer.
2843<>1<>The American wagyu choices were organic beef from Idaho, I believe.
2844<>1<>The moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, I was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.
2845<>1<>They were the first to make love to that meat.
2846<>1<>I have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.
2847<>1<>The flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.
2848<>1<>The beef melted in my mouth as I could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.
2849<>1<>Like I said before, If you come here.
2850<>1<>Go for the American Wagyu.
2851<>1<>Pricey?
2852<>1<>yes.
2853<>1<>Absolutely worth it?
2854<>1<>Hell F***ING YES~!!!
2855<>1<>Wine:  Malbec.
2856<>1<>Ran the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.
2857<>1<>Great wine with the meal.
2858<>1<>Soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.
2859<>1<>The wine was a hit with the table.
2860<>1<>But at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.
2861<>0<>Congrats Alex!
2862<>0<>Hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!
2863<>0<>!
2864<>1<>We went here for my boyfriend's birthday.
2865<>0<>We didn't end up making a reservation because we were debating between CUT and another restaurant, but we were able to sit in the lounge and order dinner.
2866<>1<>The food was amazing!
2867<>1<>I ended up ordering the sole because we had just had steak the night before.
2868<>1<>It was the best!
2869<>1<>So moist and delicious.
2870<>1<>They also brought a complimentary dessert for his birthday.
2871<>1<>While it's definitely pricey, it was worth it in my opinion and I can't wait to go back.
2872<>1<>One of the best steakhouses in Vegas.
2873<>1<>One of the few to serve Japanese Kobe beef.
2874<>1<>Only had the privilege of trying this place twice in the past six months.
2875<>1<>No reservations either time (we just walked in after a successful day of poker at the Venetian.)
2876<>1<>No problems.
2877<>1<>Service was outstanding (although we are biased since we knew some of the servers).
2878<>1<>The ambiance is very modern yet comfortable.
2879<>1<>You know you are in a new American steakhouse.
2880<>1<>The appetizers were very good but not memorable.
2881<>1<>This is because the steaks are the focus of this restaurant.
2882<>1<>Servers will come to your table and show you the different cuts and grades of beef before you place your order.
2883<>1<>I was ready to eat the steak raw at that moment.
2884<>1<>Strongly recommend the American Kobe.
2885<>1<>This cut is not as rich as the Japanese Kobe but based on the portion size, no one can finish the Japanese Kobe.
2886<>1<>Prime steaks are OK but common, you can get that in your home town.
2887<>0<>As always, we skipped the sides.
2888<>1<>The focus in on the steaks.
2889<>1<>One note, be careful with the amount of bread you consume.
2890<>1<>It's easy to fill up before you even get to the steaks.
2891<>1<>The soft pretzel is outstanding and the breadsticks are so crisp that I showered my guest twice with crumbs; sorry.
2892<>1<>The wine list is well chosen and includes many of the trendiest boutique wines from the new world.
2893<>1<>Watch out, you can easily overspend.
2894<>1<>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
2895<>1<>We all talk about the bone marrow flan because it's one of the most novel dishes at this Wolfgang Puck steakhouse.
2896<>1<>The pureed mushrooms add a mellow earthy accent to the otherwise robust and rich bone marrow.
2897<>1<>As far as steak houses go, it's a solid choice but you're clearly paying for the WP brand.
2898<>1<>The Cut clearly prides itself on steak and offering an assortment of the best cuts of beef from around the world.
2899<>1<>Whether you're looking at Idaho, Nebraska, or Japan.
2900<>1<>Ever spend $155 of a 8 ounces of steak?
2901<>1<>Might as well live it up in Vegas.
2902<>1<>Are there better choices in Vegas?
2903<>1<>Sure.
2904<>1<>But you might as well live it up while you're at the Venetian.
2905<>0<>[Original Visit: December 2013]
2906<>1<>Best steak I've ever had, and the service was amazing!
2907<>1<>Our waiter made excellent recommendations.
2908<>1<>Can't wait to visit again.
2909<>0<>I visited Cut - Las Vegas on Sunday, 6/13.
2910<>1<>I have had dinner at a few of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants before but so far, this restaurant is the best one.
2911<>1<>I ordered filet mignon.
2912<>1<>Honestly, this is one of the best filet mignon steaks that I had in my life.
2913<>1<>Dessert was also great.
2914<>1<>I had a banana cream pie.
2915<>1<>I truly enjoyed it.
2916<>1<>If I have a chance to visit Vegas in the future,certainly, this restaurant will be my first stop.
2917<>0<>First of all, I don't eat meat so I can't really give a critique on their steaks.
2918<>0<>So, why would a person who doesn't eat meat review this place?
2919<>0<>Well, because not everyone eats meat and because I can and I want to.
2920<>1<>But on the real, regardless, meat eater or not, you gotta try CUT.
2921<>1<>The restaurant itself is so chic, the decor is beautiful as well the menus (I have a thing for fonts and paper, fyi); hell, even the staff is nice to look at :] No but forreal, the staff is really nice and are there for everything.
2922<>1<>Yes I mean everything; they do the whole pull your chair out, put the napkin over your lap thing.
2923<>1<>I wish they'd feed me next time LOL The bathrooms are really nice too!
2924<>1<>The only gripe I have would be about those wooden floors; they're slippery as hell.
2925<>1<>Now on to the food.
2926<>1<>The variety of bread they offer is off the chain; the focacciaa was frikkin amazing!
2927<>1<>I ordered the "Butter Lettuce, Avocado, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette".
2928<>1<>Okay, yea, I'm the first one to say "salad is just salad" but this salad is not just a salad.
2929<>1<>It's like the most epic tasting salad I've had... ever and I've had my share of salads.
2930<>1<>Everything was just like butta' melting in my mouth: so creamy and velvety.
2931<>1<>Prety much it was really FRIKKIN GOOD!
2932<>1<>All the ingredients were really fresh and the vinaigrette and cheese were delicious.
2933<>1<>And damn the water was good too.
2934<>1<>So no complaints.
2935<>1<>Pricewise, like other people have said expect to pay somewhere between $100-$175 per person.
2936<>1<>I didn't spend nearly as much because I just got the salad and a water.
2937<>1<>All in all, the experience and food were exceptional.
2938<>1<>Straight good!
2939<>1<>Had the American Wagyu Filet, melts in your mouth.
2940<>1<>Cooked perfect, incredible flavor and just the right amount.
2941<>1<>I've eaten here a few times now, and every time, everything is pretty incredible.
2942<>1<>The bread is good, the salads are good, the sides are awesome.
2943<>1<>What more can I say?
2944<>1<>Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
2945<>1<>Ate at Cut on a Thursday night when I had 7 buddies in town for the NCAA tournament.
2946<>1<>The food, as most of the yelpers indicate, was fantastic.
2947<>1<>We got an array of appetizers, the pork belly was probably the run away winner.
2948<>1<>The majority of us got the dry aged ribeye, which is smaller than the other option.
2949<>1<>The flavor is much better on the dry aged version, it's worth the extra price and losing a little in terms of the size of the steak.
2950<>1<>The service was excellent.
2951<>1<>We never were wanting for a wine pour and our water glasses were never empty.
2952<>1<>I will say that Carnevino is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, with the riserva ribeye being my favorite steak ever.
2953<>1<>This is also located in the Palazzo.
2954<>1<>But, Cut is excellent, right up there with any steakhouse in the city.
2955<>1<>If you are at Venetian or Palazzo, both Cut and Carnevino are highly recommended.
2956<>1<>Keep in mind, Cut is expensive, so plan accordingly.
2957<>1<>One of the best steaks I've had.
2958<>1<>had the rib eye.. it was one of the most tender rib eye steaks I've had.
2959<>1<>Corn / cream spinach side dishes were great.
2960<>0<>Some of my friends had the filet mignon and they weren't terrible impressed with it.
2961<>1<>but... this is about what I ate and i thought my meal was amazing.
2962<>1<>How do you say WOW backwards?
2963<>0<>A girlfriend of mine mentioned that she wanted pizza and I was hesitant because I am a little bit of a pizza snob having had great pies in the northeast.
2964<>0<>Why would I look in the southwest for good bread, bruschetta and salads?
2965<>1<>Try the eggplant and sausage bruschetta in your medley of four.
2966<>1<>I did not have one arrangement that was not amazing on the lips!
2967<>0<>I was happy they had a happy hour menu but it meant that you had to sit in a certain area deemed to be the "bar" versus the restaurant.
2968<>1<>That was a bit crazy...and now that I remember, I have to remove one star from the rating just because of that policy..silly!
2969<>1<>Let me say that the ambience is nice and trendy and just cheesey enough to be okay...I mean do you really need a fake digital fireplace reflected on your wall?
2970<>0<>No really?
2971<>0<>Do you?
2972<>1<>And who is that woman muralled in the restaurant?
2973<>1<>And with all these questions and concerns, I would certainly return since the food is soo tasty.
2974<>1<>We've been here a number of times.
2975<>1<>The margarita and bocca trio pizzas are very good.
2976<>1<>Always have a nice crust, fresh toppings, and the wines by the glass are above average.
2977<>1<>Cool and casual atmosphere with good service.
2978<>1<>Will continue to go back.
2979<>1<>While Mill Avenue remains a shadow of its former glory, there still are some great spots for grownups to have a good time.
2980<>1<>La Bocca Urban Pizzeria & Wine Bar is one of those places.
2981<>1<>I enjoyed a great Happy Hour and meal with a group of couples before walking down the street to Gammage for a show.
2982<>1<>The restaurant has a nice modern hipster feel.
2983<>1<>The tables have a bit of a picnic table feel to them, but not the cheap kind).
2984<>1<>There's also a great patio that is on the alley side of the restaurant, so diners won't get pounded by the sun on a hot day and won't have to put up with too much of the Mill Avenue crowd.
2985<>1<>The menu is exactly what you'd expect to find.
2986<>1<>A satisfying mix of pizzas, pastas, salads, and bites, many made with ingredients from local vendors.
2987<>1<>My table split a med plate (hummus, babaganoush, peppers, cheese and pita and flat bred.
2988<>1<>The hummus wasn't the best in the valley, but the babaganoush was phenomenal.
2989<>1<>We all had a variety of pizzas and salads.
2990<>1<>I personally had the truffled mushroom.
2991<>1<>Awesome first slice, but the over use of truffle oil eventually made hard to finish.
2992<>1<>One friend checked in on Yelp and we received a free dessert.
2993<>1<>We went with a warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (made with Sweet Republic's vanilla bean ice cream).
2994<>1<>A perfectly baked little "pizza cookie."
2995<>1<>La Bocca is also coming to local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).
2996<>1<>$30 for $15.
2997<>1<>That will be a worthwhile deal when it's available.
2998<>0<>Mill Street was entertaining...I met up with a friend from Az while visiting my mom and sister here because the Sushi place accross the street went out of business...  We sat outside and I got to watch everyone as they walke by.
2999<>1<>We had a antipasta plate, was very good.
3000<>0<>I havent really eve had anything like it.
3001<>xx<>The drinks were good and the waiter we had was quirky and professional.
3002<>xx<>We went on a Monday night and was not busy at all, of course!
3003<>xx<>Also had a pizzookie, YUMM!
3004<>xx<>I recently went here with co-workers to celebrate a co-worker's birthday.
3005<>xx<>All of them loved what they ordered... a few even expressed that the pizza rivals Pizzeria Bianco's pizza.
3006<>xx<>That is a big compliment.
3007<>xx<>They have a great wine list, good food and a really cool loungy atmosphere.
3008<>xx<>It's great for large groups (we had 10+ for lunch) and for group get togethers (we had 10+ reunion at happy hour).
3009<>xx<>Great service and food.
3010<>xx<>Ordered a pizza, however it was overly greasy for my taste.
3011<>xx<>Other than that it tasted excellent!
3012<>xx<>Love this place!!
3013<>xx<>My wife who thankfully handles our home finances made a comment the other day that I must love La Bocca because it is on my credit card statement about 2x/week.
3014<>xx<>I know that sounds crazy but I work on Mill Avenue.
3015<>xx<>No, I am not a street performer but work for a local advertising agency and the restaurant options if you are looking for good pizza and wine or beer is non existent.
3016<>xx<>I have tried about 1/2 the menu and all delicious.
3017<>xx<>The service and atmosphere is great and the managers/owners make us feel quite welcome and wanting to go back.
3018<>xx<>If you are in the Mill Ave area definitely stop into La Bocca.
3019<>xx<>Start out with their awesome bruschetta planks appetizer for $12.
3020<>xx<>You get 4 bruschetta but can mix and match from about 8 or so different kinds.
3021<>xx<>My fav is the prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, and truffle oil.
3022<>xx<>I know that sounds odd (fig??)
3023<>xx<>but its really really good.
3024<>xx<>I would recommend for lunch either going for the turkey & brie sandwich or margarita pizza with your favorite topics.
3025<>xx<>Pepperoni is great.
3026<>xx<>They also have really good beer.
3027<>xx<>Try either the Franziskaner, Dunkelweiss, or Hoegaarden.
3028<>xx<>Probably first menu (is it obvious?)
3029<>xx<>that I have memorized and don't mind that I did.
3030<>xx<>Happy hour deals are also awesome.
3031<>xx<>I wish there was a La Bocca in North Scottsdale as I would probably end up going on the weekend too as I live in that area.
3032<>xx<>there hummus is the best hummus i have ever had!!
3033<>xx<>and the flatbread is to die for!
3034<>xx<>Love the atmosphere!
3035<>xx<>just wish there was happy hour for the food too.
3036<>xx<>the pear salad is really good too!!!
3037<>xx<>so yummy!
3038<>xx<>!
3039<>xx<>Trendy.
3040<>xx<>Loved the patio seating.
3041<>xx<>Ordered the Bruchetta.
3042<>xx<>Fig/Arugula was my fav.
3043<>xx<>We came here on a Thursday night with a large group of 20 plus.
3044<>xx<>The place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu groups/seating.
3045<>xx<>The service was great.
3046<>xx<>The servers checked-in on us as a group and individually.
3047<>xx<>Without even asking, they kept all our bills separately which made settling the check a breeze.
3048<>xx<>Trust me, that is a huge undertaking in group settings.
3049<>xx<>Decent list of wine selections.
3050<>xx<>The pizza was delicious.
3051<>xx<>Definitely a cool chill place to be if you want to get away from the craziness everywhere else on Mill.
3052<>xx<>Always get animal style burgers.
3053<>xx<>Goodluck eating outside in the summer Four adults fit on the shaded side of the bench one person is left in the sun roasting like a mofo.
3054<>xx<>Remember it closes on fri and sat  at1:30am.
3055<>xx<>I'm glad I read the reviews, I never knew they you can get your burgers "animal style."
3056<>xx<>Too bad the shake machine was broken when I went.
3057<>xx<>If you stayed at the Excalibur like me you can walk to this location.
3058<>xx<>Try not to walk alone though.
3059<>xx<>thank goodness i know about animal style.
3060<>xx<>it was my first time having in N out since i'm from the east coast and we dont have any here!
3061<>xx<>the burger was juicy and delicious and perfectly compiled of onions, lettuce, tomato, and thousand island dressing, with a non frozen beef patty!
3062<>xx<>animal style is not advertised on the menu but order it like that and you won't regret it!
3063<>xx<>their fries are yummy too!
3064<>xx<>i wish i had a box to fly home with me!
3065<>xx<>delicious lunch and ample seating at this location!
3066<>xx<>Normally, we don't really eat cheeseburgers, but whenever we are in California or Vegas, we always stop at In-N-Out for cheeseburgers.
3067<>xx<>We can't help ourselves.
3068<>xx<>I don't think any of their ingredients are "special" per se, unless by "special" we mean fresh, made-to-order, and delicious because that is what In-N-Out is all about.
3069<>xx<>We scoped this location from our hotel window on the Strip and made a bee-line over there before the lunch crowd.
3070<>xx<>While still slightly crowded, we got our order soon and enjoyed every.
3071<>xx<>single.
3072<>xx<>bite.
3073<>xx<>After driving for hours to Las Vegas, the boyfriend and I wanted something quick to eat and to stretch out our legs.
3074<>xx<>The place wasn`t too busy, but wasn`t dead, and service was quick.
3075<>xx<>We ordered two Double Doubles with onions (one Animal Style for the boyfriend) and two Animal Style Fries.
3076<>xx<>Yes, I said two.
3077<>xx<>Being in the car for a couple hours with no food makes you pretty hungry and irritated.
3078<>xx<>We inhaled everything and everything was so good.
3079<>xx<>Full and satisfied.
3080<>xx<>Now off to play on the Strip!
3081<>xx<>Double-Double animal style with well-done animal style fries!
3082<>xx<>Need I say more?
3083<>xx<>!
3084<>xx<>Still one of if not my favorite Burger   and I have to get one every time I am in  a state with InNOut as we don't have them in Seattle  so from down town take the bus up the strip too Dean Martin Way then cross the street & catch the 201 west bound and it will let you off just across the street from this InNOut  Had me a Double Double Animal Style and some fries, oh yeah the Tummy was sedated for a few hours, wish I had Animal Styled the fries also, oh well next time baby   right next door just across the lot at this location they have a gift shop with Hats, Shirts, Back Packs, Travel Mugs, and Jackets plus a few other little gifts to show your InNOut Pride
3085<>xx<>Wonderful - as always.
3086<>xx<>I love this burger, I go ever time I am out west which is not often enough.
3087<>xx<>You have to try the animal style.
3088<>xx<>I would say everyone that heads to Vegas needs to head over to In-N-Out and enjoy a tasty burger, and some wonderful hand cut fries.
3089<>xx<>I hope at some point we can get them to come east.
3090<>xx<>DUH!!
3091<>xx<>are you kidding...why do you think this place is like a cult fenom????
3092<>xx<>come on....best shakes ever...maybe get them half and half (half flavor half vanilla-bc they tend to be very rich) and their burgers are really good...come on-a place that offers grilled onions into the cheese on my cheese burger plus raw ones??
3093<>xx<>sign me up...(also sign me up for mouth wash!!!)
3094<>xx<>most places are never worth the hype but this place is!!
3095<>xx<>!
3096<>xx<>My husband and I had another delicious dinner, at Happy Hour, at Brio's in Town Square in Las Vegas.
3097<>xx<>The professionalism of the staff namely, Brian (manager), Alyssa and Mike (bartenders), is beyond compare.
3098<>xx<>Besides delicious dishes, such as beef carpaccio and spicy shrimp and eggplant in a delicious spicy sauce, we also feasted on crispy shrimp served on a delicious bed of greens.
3099<>xx<>The Brio burger is still a must have order, for sure.
3100<>xx<>I must say that it is definitely worth your time, and you owe it to your tastebuds, to enjoy The Brio Restaurant and all it has to offer.
3101<>xx<>J&D (NYC)
3102<>xx<>We had the pesto pasta with a side of Alfredo, half chicken and mashed potatoes, and the lamb chops!
3103<>xx<>It was all so delicious and the bruschetta Quattro was amazing!
3104<>xx<>I loved the tomato and mozzarella!
3105<>xx<>The lamb chops were by far the best I've had, not greasy at all and very flavorful!
3106<>xx<>The mashed potatoes were also cooked so fluffy and delicious!
3107<>xx<>I went to Brio 3 times already so this review is long due.
3108<>xx<>I was always very pleased with the prices, variety, quality, the smaller plates menu, mini desserts...
3109<>xx<>I came here once with my bff and twice with chris before his bball games (he likes to have a big plate of pastas first for energy)  I always have smaller plates from the low carb menu, My favorites are so far: beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, shrimp Mediterranean on orzo and spinach bed and mini creme brulee served in espresso cup!
3110<>xx<>The tiramisu is very good too, it's my friend's favorite!
3111<>xx<>The shrimptini is just ok, the shrimps were small and a bit watery but the shrimps from the entrees are huge, nicely grilled and delicious.
3112<>xx<>The service was always great except one time when our waitress never refilled our iced teas until we asked for it again and again... Then had our refill finally when we paid our bill.
3113<>xx<>Not cool.
3114<>xx<>I am not asking for extra attention,  just for drink/water during my meal.
3115<>xx<>The service the other times was perfectly on point and everybody else was very friendly.
3116<>xx<>So we will come back tomorrow night for sure and I will make sure to update my review by then.
3117<>xx<>Changed the happy Hour from 3-6:30 instead 3-7 Not 2.95 any more its 3.95$  &&& My bruschetta is gone.
3118<>xx<>Sad so sad.
3119<>xx<>I really Loved the bruschetta with bellpepper.
3120<>xx<>I like the New menu but bring the Old One back.
3121<>xx<>raising the Price is Not a Great idea.
3122<>xx<>:-((( its just 1$ but if you Order 6 items or more then its 6$ more.
3123<>xx<>Our waiter was either overworked or overmatched.
3124<>xx<>Regardless of this we had to keep reminding him that we were there.
3125<>xx<>Outdoor seating was actually quite noisy.
3126<>xx<>Food was okay, but poor service demands a less than average rating.
3127<>xx<>'okay for kids' : not sure how to answer this.
3128<>xx<>I would not say 'great' for kids, I would say 'average' for kids.
3129<>xx<>I am currently eating at Brio in Las Vegas' Town Square Mall.
3130<>xx<>I am not sure if this was an off day but the service was  not good.
3131<>xx<>I had to ask for items repeatedly.
3132<>xx<>The food was OK but nothing to scream about.
3133<>xx<>Overall,I am disappointed and will not come back.
3134<>xx<>You rarely get a second time to make a first impression.
3135<>xx<>I come here very often, and I only eat outside... only once has the service been mediocre.
3136<>xx<>Everything I've ordered has been amazing... my favorites are the strawberry chicken salad, the lobster ravioli, the shrimp on eggplant appetizer... yum.
3137<>xx<>Love the mojitos, too.
3138<>xx<>My only complaint would be the reception, it always seems cold, or that they're a little stressed about seating you.
3139<>xx<>I didn't knock it down any stars though, because I quickly forget about it once I get inside.
3140<>xx<>WOW.
3141<>xx<>SO GOOD.
3142<>xx<>this is a solid 4.5 but i rounded up because of our experience there  this was the place for our last night in vegas dinner and wow was it such a good choice.
3143<>xx<>location & pricing: the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth every penny.
3144<>xx<>the location of it is in the heart of the shopping center or square or whatever its called.
3145<>xx<>atmosphere: this place inside and out - was so nice.
3146<>xx<>they had nice couches outside, and a plush entryway, and a wonderful setting on the inside.
3147<>xx<>it was a pretty ornate looking interior.
3148<>xx<>dim lights, curtains, rich carpets.
3149<>xx<>taste: AHHH SOSOSO GOOD.
3150<>xx<>we ordered the brio's bruschetta trio, and since we didn't know what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations.
3151<>xx<>what great recommendations that STEVE gave us.
3152<>xx<>we got the bistecca alla fiorentina, artichoke encrusted beef medallions, pasta brio, and the mushroom ravioli al forno.
3153<>xx<>it was soooo delicious.
3154<>xx<>perfect seasoning, perfect spice & flavor.
3155<>xx<>oh and the complimentary bread!!
3156<>xx<>we had crispy and soft bread.
3157<>xx<>so we did order the brio's bruschetta trio, but we didn't actually get to try it - steve totally forgot about it and cancelled the bruschetta and offered us the dolchino sampler: peach cobbler, mocha mousse?, creme brulee, cheesecake with a raspberry sauce, applebread, milk chocolate cake with caramel, and tiramisu.
3158<>xx<>the only bad thing is that it was a little "too much of a good thing" scenario.
3159<>xx<>while it was so decadent and wonderful, it was a little too rich to finish everything even amongst the four of us (one guy and three girls)  service: STEVE.
3160<>xx<>impeccable.
3161<>xx<>we even got his card - he works everyday except sunday (to watch football), and when we are back (and WE WILL!)
3162<>xx<>we're going to make sure in hell that we sit at steve's table.
3163<>xx<>The desserts.
3164<>xx<>Delicious.
3165<>xx<>The setting was upscale casual, food was good, nothing superb, but overall a good place to enjoy a nice dinnner
3166<>xx<>Friday night was the second time I've visited this place.
3167<>xx<>Atmosphere was nice, pretty dark, servers were very attentive but the food was not something that I would go back for.
3168<>xx<>Especially a third time.
3169<>xx<>Prices are pretty high but I was out with a friend and didnt have the family so that was ok.
3170<>xx<>But the food once again was just mediocre.
3171<>xx<>I ended up having the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto.
3172<>xx<>Sauce drowned everything out and made it very soggy tasting...The only thing that made up for the food was that I wasnt paying and my peach bellini (AMAZING)...
3173<>xx<>Food was OK, but not outstanding.
3174<>xx<>This review is more on the negative side due to the expectations of a  "gluten free menu" and lack of delivery.
3175<>xx<>We had a guest in town with a gluten allergy and found that they advertise a GF menu.
3176<>xx<>Excited to find some place to take our guests, the menu and excitement quickly faded.
3177<>xx<>Their GF menu lists a burger (and sandwiches), but it wasn't really a burger.
3178<>xx<>It was just the patty with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onion and pickle.
3179<>xx<>That's not a burger, then fries were not an option (oil is used to cook battered onion rings, chicken, etc).
3180<>xx<>So burger and fries, became a patty and salad.
3181<>xx<>Why bother with a special GF menu?
3182<>xx<>You can order the same way off the regular menu, by skipping the fries and say no bun.
3183<>xx<>Other non-GF plates ordered were pretty basic.
3184<>xx<>Wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, especially if our food allergy guest comes back.
3185<>xx<>If you have a gluten allergy, skip this place and go to the Chesesecake Factory in Henderson and get a real burger with the bun and fries...all GF.
3186<>xx<>Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.
3187<>xx<>Went here last night to try the Gardein line here.
3188<>xx<>I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes.
3189<>xx<>How cool is that??
3190<>xx<>But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian.
3191<>xx<>They cook everything on the same grill as the meat.
3192<>xx<>What sense does this make?
3193<>xx<>None.
3194<>xx<>It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted.
3195<>xx<>If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point?
3196<>xx<>And here comes why it is 2-star.
3197<>xx<>IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN.
3198<>xx<>You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill.
3199<>xx<>Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food?
3200<>xx<>HELL NO.
3201<>xx<>Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else.
3202<>xx<>But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay.
3203<>xx<>It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat.
3204<>xx<>If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years.
3205<>xx<>Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat.
3206<>xx<>You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's.
3207<>xx<>It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian.
3208<>xx<>Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today.
3209<>xx<>Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu.
3210<>xx<>Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.
3211<>xx<>Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries.
3212<>xx<>Matt ordered a thai "chicken" pizza.
3213<>xx<>After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce.
3214<>xx<>The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster.
3215<>xx<>Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything.
3216<>xx<>We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is.
3217<>xx<>After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food.
3218<>xx<>Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders?
3219<>xx<>NOTHING else?
3220<>xx<>No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard?
3221<>xx<>For serious?
3222<>xx<>The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous.
3223<>xx<>The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price.
3224<>xx<>I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders.
3225<>xx<>At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings.
3226<>xx<>It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress.
3227<>xx<>I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja.
3228<>xx<>Not the best customer service in the world.
3229<>xx<>I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse.
3230<>xx<>Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns.
3231<>xx<>Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats?
3232<>xx<>I just don't get that logic.
3233<>xx<>Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can.
3234<>xx<>Plain sliders are not okay.
3235<>xx<>In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders.
3236<>xx<>Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu.
3237<>xx<>The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon.
3238<>xx<>I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle.
3239<>xx<>Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.
3240<>xx<>I've been to Yardhouse several times.
3241<>xx<>I like that they have so much beer on tap.
3242<>xx<>My wife enjoys the Rose Gaarden (a mix of framboise and Hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and I usually go with the Rogue Hazelnut brown.
3243<>xx<>The food has always been solid.
3244<>xx<>The (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian poke stack is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger.
3245<>xx<>So why the three stars?
3246<>xx<>Well, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed.
3247<>xx<>To be fair, it was a Saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (Ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.
3248<>xx<>Lest you think I'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.
3249<>xx<>We had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five.
3250<>xx<>The host said he'd have us an extra chair in "just a second," after which I saw him speak to our waiter.
3251<>xx<>Our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair.
3252<>xx<>I stood there, waiting, for five minutes while I saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair.
3253<>xx<>I finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before I got one.
3254<>xx<>This kind of set the tone for the evening, but I didn't know it at the time.
3255<>xx<>Finally sitting, we ordered drinks.
3256<>xx<>One of our guests ordered a framboise.
3257<>xx<>That's pronounced "fram-bwahs" due to the final E. This is important in a second, so hold on.
3258<>xx<>Our waiter replied "that's framb-wah."
3259<>xx<>My wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs.
3260<>xx<>I know this sounds like a silly thing, but   1. she's right, and 2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing.
3261<>xx<>3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?
3262<>xx<>Our waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that.
3263<>xx<>Okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something.
3264<>xx<>Not going to let it bother me.
3265<>xx<>Hold on, because this is where it gets weird.
3266<>xx<>That's when he started blowing us off.
3267<>xx<>We had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it.
3268<>xx<>He passed our table six times (six times!
3269<>xx<>yes, I counted!)
3270<>xx<>without even offering to refill our drinks until I finally had to flag him down.
3271<>xx<>When he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.
3272<>xx<>Explain that.
3273<>xx<>I'll wait.
3274<>xx<>Look, bottom line, I'm still going to go to Yardhouse.
3275<>xx<>In fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths.
3276<>xx<>I'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me.
3277<>xx<>But if I get sat in his section again, I'm going to ask to be moved.
3278<>xx<>The Yard House is a great place for appetizers, drinks at the bar, dinner, and just hanging out with friends.
3279<>xx<>I love the atmosphere and the one draw back is that it seems everyone else always has the same idea to go when I do.
3280<>xx<>So my only suggestion is to arrive to be pleased, have fun, and above all patient to be seated or find a spot at the bar.
3281<>xx<>My most recent excursion was for an ill advised late night snack that had me succumb to the delicious Calimari.
3282<>xx<>I do love to order this dish in many places but I always love how here it's prepared fresh and hot, and rather quickly and accompanied with the spicy tomato and tartar sauce.
3283<>xx<>I love the plentiful dipping sauce and attentive service for more on request.
3284<>xx<>I also appreciate how this is a place that serves fresh brewed ice tea for those of us in a hiatus from imbibing the many beers available on tap.
3285<>xx<>So if you're a drinker, have plenty of hungry friends, love ice tea, and just want a fun time, check out Yard House.
3286<>xx<>An all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple TVs!
3287<>xx<>With it being Vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!
3288<>xx<>Walking in on a Saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.
3289<>xx<>Call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!
3290<>xx<>If you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.
3291<>xx<>They say they do offer the "World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer."
3292<>xx<>You can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!
3293<>xx<>But if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.
3294<>xx<>It's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.
3295<>xx<>The best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.
3296<>xx<>The tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.
3297<>xx<>We went for a variety of appetizers to share:  * Grilled Jamaican Wings: "tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce" $10.25 - A generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.
3298<>xx<>Full of flavor though and tasty!
3299<>xx<>* Firecracker Wings: "tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze" $10.25 - Favored over the Jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.
3300<>xx<>* Grilled Hearts of Romaine: "topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette" $8.95 - Good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.
3301<>xx<>Even the guys in our group were fighting over it!
3302<>xx<>* Baby Leaf Spinach: "portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette" $7.95 - Not enough portabella mushrooms, but I like the Gouda.
3303<>xx<>* Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip: "main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a four cheese blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread" $11.45 - Good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.
3304<>xx<>* Barnaise Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - The fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.
3305<>xx<>Even the thin fries taste good!
3306<>xx<>* Classic Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle" $9.95 - Only okay after you try the Barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.
3307<>xx<>* Fresh Baked Brownie: "topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream" $7.95 - Takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.
3308<>xx<>* Draft Beer Float: "Lindeman's Framboise with vanilla ice cream" $6.50 - Like a root beer float, but with Lindeman's.
3309<>xx<>They do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.
3310<>xx<>There's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.
3311<>xx<>The noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.
3312<>xx<>(Not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.
3313<>xx<>But a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.
3314<>xx<>We ran into quite a few people we knew that Saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)
3315<>xx<>Since I'm still not a beer drinker, I like the Yard House because they serve up Lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and Wyder's.
3316<>xx<>I can drink something I enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.
3317<>xx<>They do offer Happy Hours: Monday through Friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; Sunday through Wednesday, 11 pm to close.
3318<>xx<>Select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.
3319<>xx<>After 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.
3320<>xx<>The crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.
3321<>xx<>There's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.
3322<>xx<>This place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their "Kids Klub."
3323<>xx<>But you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.
3324<>xx<>Update!
3325<>xx<>05/31/08 - This time tried their (Mac & Cheese)2 "roasted chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil."
3326<>xx<>Next time, I'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.
3327<>xx<>But so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.
3328<>xx<>My favorite restaurant in Vegas!
3329<>xx<>Great nachos and lettuce wraps!
3330<>xx<>Wow!
3331<>xx<>Now that's what I call a Beer Selection.
3332<>xx<>If you are in Vegas and want to sample some beers, this is a great place to check out.
3333<>xx<>Unfortunately for me, I came here a day after my birthday and I was still in major recovery mode so I did not really get to take advantage of their abundant beer list.
3334<>xx<>Their food was just okay for me but then again, maybe me being in recovery mode affected my taste buds too so maybe I'd give them another shot.
3335<>xx<>Definitely will be back at least to get some beers as I love fresh beer.
3336<>xx<>Bottled beer does not do the name "Beer" justice.
3337<>xx<>And the service was excellent all around.
3338<>xx<>Since we had to wait for a table, we actually hung out at the bar for about 20 to 30 mins.
3339<>xx<>And since they had so many beers, we needed to ask the bartender for advice.
3340<>xx<>He was extremely patient with us.
3341<>xx<>And once we sat down at our table, again, the server, was excellent.
3342<>xx<>She kept coming around every few minutes to check on us and make sure everything was okay.
3343<>xx<>3 Words: BEER!
3344<>xx<>BEER!
3345<>xx<>BEER!
3346<>xx<>My second time at a Yard House restaurant, the first time was in Pasadena, CA and the food was not enjoyable.
3347<>xx<>This Yard House location was great!
3348<>xx<>We had a group of 18 and didn't make reservations, the manager got us seated as soon as possible.
3349<>xx<>Our servers took our drink and food orders quickly and made sure the little kids got their food first.
3350<>xx<>Everyone was pleased with their meals and one of our servers brought over a free habanero beer sampler for my brother.
3351<>xx<>The staff were patient with us as we were a large group and didn't seem to mind all the kids running around.
3352<>xx<>The service here was great and I really appreciated that.
3353<>xx<>Usually very happy with yard house but could tell that my server was overwhelmed which is completely understood.
3354<>xx<>I ask for the sweet potatoes fries to come out before our meal and it came out with the main meal and felt like the main order was never going to come out.
3355<>xx<>I was disappointed that he not once checked on us to see if we were happy with everything.
3356<>xx<>The food was delicious but the service was not so good.
3357<>xx<>I have heard many reviews on this place but I have finally had the opportunity to go myself.
3358<>xx<>I ordered a burger, medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly.
3359<>xx<>The array of burgers that they had was very different, I like the variety.
3360<>xx<>They had my favorite beer as well.
3361<>xx<>I think they were a bit high on their prices but for a nice splurge on a good burger, its worth it.
3362<>xx<>The restaurant itself was very nice as well, lots of windows and the staff was very polite.
3363<>xx<>Having been to their Sister Establishments; China Grill Co, I had high expectation for this place.
3364<>xx<>I am a huge fan of Asian Fusion anything.
3365<>xx<>I would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.
3366<>xx<>This place was extremely busy with your traditional lounge down tempo music playing.
3367<>xx<>It has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.
3368<>xx<>We made RSVP and got seated within 10 minutes.
3369<>xx<>Here we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.
3370<>xx<>After getting bumped several times I asked to be moved.
3371<>xx<>Then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.
3372<>xx<>There was no room to move.
3373<>xx<>I told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.
3374<>xx<>So far, even worse start.
3375<>xx<>Now the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the AMEX.
3376<>xx<>We asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.
3377<>xx<>He even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.
3378<>xx<>We ordered the Tuna Taquitos which was unique with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.
3379<>xx<>We had the Yellow Tail Carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny.
3380<>xx<>I had the Filet Mignon,small and pricey but again worth it.
3381<>xx<>Jennifer had the Sea Bass, again soft and unique flavors, we also had the lamb chop from the Robata and it is the best lamb chop I had recently.
3382<>xx<>We also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.
3383<>xx<>For desserts we had the Donut Holes dipped in melting chocolate.
3384<>xx<>Again,the great taste!!!
3385<>xx<>The service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were unique a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.
3386<>xx<>The portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are unique - Japanese with Brazilian.
3387<>xx<>The table next to us were from Europe (whom thought this place was as of value, I guest that what happens when you get a Euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses.
3388<>xx<>The server did too.
3389<>xx<>The next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.
3390<>xx<>Sushi Samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.
3391<>xx<>To start we were seated right away and everyone from the host group to our server was wonderful.
3392<>xx<>They all made great suggestions on drink and food orders and all suggestions were great!
3393<>xx<>Our food was awesome.
3394<>xx<>I had never been to the Chicago location and everything we ate here was so flavorful.
3395<>xx<>It was a bit pricey, but it's Vegas and the food was totally worth it.
3396<>xx<>I can't wait to go back to the Chicago location.
3397<>xx<>Glad I stumbled onto this place.
3398<>xx<>I went there last Saturday (3/28) because we were going to a comedy show at the adjacent Sugarcane Lounge.
3399<>xx<>Seating was full so we sat at the bar.
3400<>xx<>Very different but intriguing menu.
3401<>xx<>As we were trying to figure out what to order, this guy next to us told us to order this, this, and that - all of which was incredible.
3402<>xx<>Turns out the guy was the owner Matt who couldn't have been more gracious and hospitable.
3403<>xx<>Everything we ordered was superb and bursting with flavor.
3404<>xx<>The only warning I would give is that the flavors are quite intense and they stayed with me most of the night.
3405<>xx<>I'm sure the people next to me at the blackjack table were none too pleased.
3406<>xx<>After throwing my money away the evening before at Koi, this was a welcome find.
3407<>xx<>Yes it's not cheap as previous reviewers stated, but being from L.A.
3408<>xx<>I'm used to spending $$$ for quality sushi.
3409<>xx<>I am planning another Vegas trip in May and Sushi Samba will definitely be on the agenda.
3410<>xx<>Highly recommended.
3411<>xx<>After writing my review on Sushi Samba, I got an email from the GM of the restaurant expressing his concern with my experience.
3412<>xx<>It was very nice of him to take the time to contact me regarding my dining experience.
3413<>xx<>I am a satisfied customer and will return to Sushi Samba in the near future.
3414<>xx<>The best sushi I have ever had....hands down.
3415<>xx<>You can't go wrong with any of the rolls but my favorite was "El Topo."
3416<>xx<>The blue point oysters were outstanding as well.
3417<>xx<>The service was excellent.
3418<>xx<>Can't wait to go back!
3419<>xx<>This place is astounding- one of the best meals I've had.
3420<>xx<>The cocktails were fresh and summery.
3421<>xx<>Items from the robata grill, both veggies and beef/sea bass, were tender and flavorful.
3422<>xx<>They served us an amazing mushroom dish with coconut milk and a mix of unique mushrooms- a real treat for the vegetarians at the table- and those of us who aren't too.
3423<>xx<>Taquitos with lump grab meat, tempura veggies.... and a dessert platter with very memorable mochi and little dessert cups that included flakes of gold!
3424<>xx<>It doesn't get any better than this.
3425<>xx<>The atmosphere is dark and hip, reflecting the sabor of Peru, Brazil, and Japan- a super innovative and successful fusion of the three countries.
3426<>xx<>Having been to Brazil twice, I liked that they projected video on the walls from Rio de Janeiro- made me nostalgic about my visits!
3427<>xx<>A classic upscale, trendy Vegas dining experience- and a fun reminder of the exciting common ground between various world cuisines.
3428<>xx<>Will definitely return!
3429<>xx<>Whenever I go to Vegas, I always go to SushiSamba.
3430<>xx<>The fusion is amazing, mixing sushi and Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine, and I would recommend the dish called El Topo...FABULOUS.
3431<>xx<>The best part is that if you do not like a dish, they will take it back and bring you something else you request, at no charge.
3432<>xx<>The music and atmosphere are lively, fantastic, and perfect before beginning a night on the town
3433<>xx<>Love sushi.
3434<>xx<>Love pan-Asian so I had high expectations.
3435<>xx<>Absolutely amazing Tuna Tataki recommended by bartender.
3436<>xx<>See my pic.
3437<>xx<>I would return here just to eat it again!Salmon sashimi was fresh but nothing memorable.
3438<>xx<>Even at the bar the service was awful, quite prompt probably due to being there 3 pm but they got orders wrong on both sides of me, and not terribly attentive.
3439<>xx<>Yes they're expensive but no more so than any similar quality restaurant.
3440<>xx<>If you want good, cheap authentic Asian food you need to go off-strip to where the locals live.
3441<>xx<>this would 100% be a 5 star review if it weren't for the pushy obnoxious waiter :(  We made it clear we just wanted a few rolls and apps...he continued to push us to have a full on meal and order super fancy expensive drinks... ALL WE WANTED WAS A FEW SUSHI ROLLS AND APPS....after about the 3rd time i said " we really just want a few rolls" he rolled his eyes in complete annoyance and snatched up the menus and walked away..EWWW..
3442<>xx<>The Sushi was delish as always...but the service really ruined it for us!!
3443<>xx<>!
3444<>xx<>Great food, small selection for me as I don't like to "fishy" sushi.
3445<>xx<>I'm more interested in rolls, but I guess you can ask the chef to make what you need.
3446<>xx<>Just not on the menu.
3447<>xx<>Overall, it was great and there was hardly ever a line.
3448<>xx<>Buyer beware, Dinner for 2 will cost you 2 HUNDRED dollars easy.
3449<>xx<>If you are an average income person this place is NOT in uou r budget.
3450<>xx<>Plus staff unfriendly n not knowledgeable.
3451<>xx<>BEWARE shared portions , they are VERY small n cost $25 plus each n are NOT shareable.
3452<>xx<>Advice, if cost is an issue, don't bother.
3453<>xx<>NOT A RUN OF THE MILL SUSHI BAR...  Well, I guess I'm a little biased with this review.
3454<>xx<>You see, I visited YT on a night where the stars were completely aligned.
3455<>xx<>Akira Back present - Check Cameraman filming Akira Back - Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone (due to the 10+ group)- Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed - Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed and making his favorite dishes - Check...mate...
3456<>xx<>I'm typically not a big Vegas sushi joint kind of guy.
3457<>xx<>I like my hole in the wall, off the beaten path sushi places.
3458<>xx<>I think that there are sushi chef's in smaller places that outperform the renowned.
3459<>xx<>Perfect example is Crazy Sushi in St. Peters, MO.
3460<>xx<>One of the best IMO.
3461<>xx<>Why do they not have a Crazy Sushi in a Vegas casino?
3462<>xx<>Thus going into YT I was skeptical, and preparing for the same roll I could get somewhere not Vegas for a lot less $$$.
3463<>xx<>Yellow tail was a great experience, and I understand why Akira has his own place at the Bellagio.
3464<>xx<>This isn't Dragon, Philly, or Vegas rolls, and if that's what you want go elsewhere because you are going to overpay for very basic sushi.
3465<>xx<>Sushi is a very tiny piece of YT.
3466<>xx<>Notice this says Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant, and not Yellowtail Sushi Bar.
3467<>xx<>There you have it...
3468<>xx<>I have still avoided going to a Vegas sushi bar.
3469<>xx<>Like I said, we were treated to a much different experience than someone who waltzed in on any given night.
3470<>xx<>Akira is not always in, and I doubt I will ever visit a restaurant again where the chef is being filmed while making my dinner.
3471<>xx<>FYI Akira Back was on Iron Chef North America...     We did a hybrid Omakase  which is the 7 course sampler.
3472<>xx<>I think we received over 7 courses, and I think this was due to Akira, and the camera guy.
3473<>xx<>Again, stars aligned...  Also we agreed with the server to let him make whatever he wants for us which probably didn't hurt either.
3474<>xx<>From the first dish which was his pizza, I started realizing why YT is different, and not a sushi bar.
3475<>xx<>I really like truffle oil when it's applied to the right dish.
3476<>xx<>You wouldn't think raw fish would mesh well with the pungent truffle oil, but it goes great with the other flavors of the pizza.
3477<>xx<>The kobe beef tataki was awesome, as was the protein roll.
3478<>xx<>The pop rock roll was just odd to say the least, but was freaking amazing.
3479<>xx<>Pop rocks in sushi WTF?
3480<>xx<>Only in Vegas.
3481<>xx<>There was also a roll brought out, and I want to say it had strawberries and tuna in it.
3482<>xx<>There was agrilled walu which was outstanding...
3483<>xx<>The kobe short rib dish he made for us was awesome as well.
3484<>xx<>I think we asked for another round of the ribs, and walu.
3485<>xx<>I could have done without the rock shrimp.
3486<>xx<>Shrimp is just meh for me.
3487<>xx<>I don't get excited over it because well... its just shrimp.
3488<>xx<>Shrimp should be the chicken of the sea, not canned tuna.
3489<>xx<>With that being said, the table loved it, and if you are a shrimp lover you'll go nuts over it.
3490<>xx<>Anyhow, those were some of the dishes that really stood out for me at YT.
3491<>xx<>I'm pretty sure we had something chicken and sashimi as well.
3492<>xx<>They were good, but drowned out by the quality of the courses I mentioned.
3493<>xx<>Appearance, flavor, and quality were top notch.
3494<>xx<>Akira Back should be very proud of his ability to be extremely creative with food, and a pallet that knows what goes.
3495<>xx<>Would I have enjoyed the restaurant as much on any other night?
3496<>xx<>I don't know.
3497<>xx<>I  wouldn't have been as daring and would have just ordered some rolls, and the pizza.
3498<>xx<>I probably wouldn't have went to YT because I would have thought it was just another sushi joint.
3499<>xx<>Things happen for a reason right?
3500<>xx<>I can share my experiences so you can either walk-in, or walk-by.
3501<>xx<>I think this place is well worth the money.
3502<>xx<>Sure it's expensive, but seriously folks... if you're worried about price why the hell are you considering eating at the Bellagio to begin with?
3503<>xx<>Hey I look for the 5.00 tables, but that's only because I am a shitty gambler.
3504<>xx<>For dinner I go all in...
3505<>xx<>I would give the food 3 stars but the atmosphere 5 stars.
3506<>xx<>We stopped in for cocktails and sushi.
3507<>xx<>The cocktails were delicious!
3508<>xx<>Although all of our sushi rolls kind of tasted the same and there wasn't much selection to choose from, the sushi was still pretty decent.
3509<>xx<>I much prefer Okada at the Wynn.
3510<>xx<>The atmosphere was great- lots of low lighting and dark woods with a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountain show.
3511<>xx<>I would come back again but probably just for cocktails and to enjoy the atmosphere.
3512<>xx<>The 4 star review is solely on their food.
3513<>xx<>I got miso soup and the California roll because I just can't do the texture of raw meats.
3514<>xx<>A friend got the pop rocks roll which creeped me out at first but after I tried it, it was the greatest thing I have ever tasted!
3515<>xx<>The tempura crab (I can't remember if it was crab or lobster) was also amazing.
3516<>xx<>Scallops were amazing too.
3517<>xx<>So tender, Like eating butter!
3518<>xx<>I got some sort of fruity mixed saki drink which was also to die for!!
3519<>xx<>I can't remember what else we got but it was all amazing.
3520<>xx<>Our waiter however was terrible.
3521<>xx<>I don't know if it was because we were all younger or what but he just didn't seem to care about us at all.
3522<>xx<>We ended up timing him based on the Bellagio fountain "shows".
3523<>xx<>We got seated in the middle of one show, and it took him until the start of the next show to even ask what we wanted to drink.
3524<>xx<>The service got worse from there.
3525<>xx<>He was really nice every time he talked to us but we seemed to burden him.
3526<>xx<>I say this because he was really attentive to literally every other table he had, except us.
3527<>xx<>Was it because we didn't order bottled water?
3528<>xx<>We were a part of 6 last fri. night.
3529<>xx<>We all probably ate the best sushi of our lives!
3530<>xx<>Their Toro Sushimi was like dessert!
3531<>xx<>Try to seat outside.
3532<>xx<>Can't go wrong with sushi and the fountain show.
3533<>xx<>Food is average to be honest.
3534<>xx<>Decent fresh sushi at the Bellagio.
3535<>xx<>Kobe steak was good, but the size of a half dollar!
3536<>xx<>Ambiance was excellent and the super model waitresses were actually quite pleasant and helpful.
3537<>xx<>Overall a good dining experience.
3538<>xx<>Yellowtail is by far one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.
3539<>xx<>I agree that the price is definitely a lot higher than your average Japanese restaurant, but aside from paying for the incredible quality of fish, you're mostly paying for the real estate so it's a great place for a date!
3540<>xx<>The ambiance is romantic and ideal for beginning your night out since they have a trendier atmosphere.
3541<>xx<>They're in Bellagio Hotel which is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip and sits by the lake overlooking the Bellagio fountains.
3542<>xx<>Also, trust me when I say this... Yellowtail has some of the best servers in the hospitality industry.
3543<>xx<>Every time I come here, the service is impeccable; personable, knowledgeable and top-notch, worthy of Bellagio.
3544<>xx<>Roll Call -   *Ahi Tuna Pizza - MY FAVORITE!
3545<>xx<>Thinly sliced grade AAAAA ahi on a light, crisp tortilla with a magical onion and mayo blend, topped with micro greens and...TRUFFLE OIL!
3546<>xx<>I've personally had friends tell me they don't like tuna OR onions OR mayo and then I introduced them to the tuna pizza and BAM!
3547<>xx<>Life-changing.
3548<>xx<>*Baked Crab Hand Roll - What is up with soy paper?
3549<>xx<>I love anything wrapped in soy paper!
3550<>xx<>And this isn't your typical grossly baked, oozing with burnt mayo roll.
3551<>xx<>The crab itself is baked, I believe.
3552<>xx<>This roll will make you MOL (Moan Out Loud).
3553<>xx<>*Crispy Kalbi Roll - I don't know how this came to be but it definitely works!
3554<>xx<>I love the texture of this roll - meaty, crunchy (from the slaw), and juicy!
3555<>xx<>It also has complementing temperatures of hot and cold in your mouth!
3556<>xx<>*Grilled Walu - Of course it's amazing and buttery and just melts in your mouth.
3557<>xx<>Just don't order too many or you may end up on the toilet the rest of the night since Walu is like a natural laxative.
3558<>xx<>You're absolutely fine if you have a few bites and it's worth the small risk since it's fatty and delicious!
3559<>xx<>And then if you want a fun novelty roll, get the Popping Spicy Crab roll.
3560<>xx<>I'm personally not big on it only because it's a pretty simple roll (crab, asparagus, cucumber) with pop rocks in it but I have to order it whenever I bring someone to Yellowtail for the first time and they always love it!
3561<>xx<>My 5 O'Clocktail is the Lychee Martini!
3562<>xx<>It pairs wonderfully with everything on the menu & you don't have to love lychee to enjoy this beverage!
3563<>xx<>Stay classy Las Vegas and thanks for stopping by!
3564<>xx<>Ate dinner here and its very modern.
3565<>xx<>Started eating on the patio which was very romantic, but it started to rain so they moved us inside.
3566<>xx<>The chef recommends 3-4 dishes each but 2 was plenty for us.
3567<>xx<>Had the lobster carpaccio and its to die for.
3568<>xx<>The soft shell crab sushi was a fabulous dish.
3569<>xx<>The place is very loud inside, so conversation was hard to have
3570<>xx<>Creative fois gras dishes and fresh yellow tail tuna sushi pieces are delectable.
3571<>xx<>Fantastic sake list.
3572<>xx<>Excellent service from the friendly bartenders.
3573<>xx<>Great place to eat dinner solo at the bar while reading and people watching.
3574<>xx<>I'm not a fan of Vegas but when I'm here for work, this is easily my favorite place to eat and chill.
3575<>xx<>Raku is one of the most unique restaurants you will find in Las Vegas.
3576<>xx<>The location is in a small strip-mall in Chinatown, an area west of the strip that has become a sort of hotspot for favorite restaurants of local foodies.
3577<>xx<>Not only is Raku in a very small strip-mall, but it's located in the very back corner of the strip-mall, barely visible from the road.
3578<>xx<>The restaurant is very small, maybe 15 tables at most, and is usually very crowded, so make sure to make reservations.
3579<>xx<>While I have had one very bad experience here due to the service, I am too loyal to great food to hate this restaurant.
3580<>xx<>I also have had too many great experiences here to let bad service ruin it for me.
3581<>xx<>But nonetheless, this should be an example of how good the food is here.
3582<>xx<>It is what brought me back after that bad experience, and I am glad it did.
3583<>xx<>The food at Raku is amazing, that's the best way I can put it.
3584<>xx<>The menu mostly consists of different skewers of meats, seafood, and vegetables.
3585<>xx<>All of them are made with the highest quality ingredients, and simply grilled over Japanese charcoal grills.
3586<>xx<>It won't sound fancy, but the flavors are so profound and so noticeable that you will appreciate their simplicity.
3587<>xx<>I have dined at Raku around 10 times now, and have compiled a list of my favorite dishes to get here.
3588<>xx<>-Yellowtail Carpaccio: Thin slices of raw yellowtail, much like sashimi.
3589<>xx<>My favorite yellowtail comes from Ichiza, but every time I come to Raku, I question if this is my favorite.
3590<>xx<>Either way, it will be some of the best Yellowtail you have ever had, so definitely try it.
3591<>xx<>-Duck w/ Balsamic Soy -Foie Gras: some of the best Foie Gras I've ever had, and that's saying a lot.
3592<>xx<>-Kobe Outside Skirt w/ Garlic: Toasted garlic on top of the very flavorful skirt steak.
3593<>xx<>-Kobe Beef Filet w/ wasabi: One of the best things on the menu.
3594<>xx<>Fresh wasabi grated on top of the very tender, flavorful Filet.
3595<>xx<>Get this!
3596<>xx<>-Kurobuta Pork Cheek: Some of the best pork you will eat.
3597<>xx<>The small layers of fat are caramelized perfectly on the grill, creating a lot of great flavor in the meat.
3598<>xx<>-Lamb Chop -Yellowtail: simply grilled yellowtail that is very tender, and perfectly cooked.
3599<>xx<>Fish of this quality needs no sauce as it melts in your mouth.
3600<>xx<>-Salmon: just like the yellowtail, melts in your mouth.
3601<>xx<>-Chicken breast wrapped in skin: chicken that is wrapped in its own skin and grilled until the skin is crispy.
3602<>xx<>-Juicy, deep-fried chicken -Chicken Thigh  There are many other great items, but these are the staple items that I think are a must.
3603<>xx<>The only problem with Raku is that it can get very expensive.
3604<>xx<>The portions of each skewer are not very large, and you will need several to get full.
3605<>xx<>The prices are anywhere from $2 for each chicken thigh skewer to $14 for the Foie Gras.
3606<>xx<>So when you get a lot of these skewers, it can add up.
3607<>xx<>I usually come to Raku for a special occasion, or a time that I am expecting to spend around $50-$75/ person.
3608<>xx<>And to be honest, it could easily end up being $100/ person if you want sake, and they have a very good selection of sake.
3609<>xx<>Do not bring your own wine in, as they do not allow it, and are very stubborn about not allowing it, as well.
3610<>xx<>Their wine list is terrible, yet for some reason they refuse to have a corkage fee.
3611<>xx<>When we went in one time, they tried to tell us it was illegal, which was clearly a lie because I've brought wine into many restaurants around Las Vegas, including other places in Chinatown.
3612<>xx<>But just know ahead of time to either drink sake, or drink bad wine.
3613<>xx<>They definitely won't let you bring your own.
3614<>xx<>The service can be very good or very bad.
3615<>xx<>As is the case with many asian restaurants, the service is not very good unless you are asian or a regular.
3616<>xx<>I've had bad service here, and I've had pretty good service here, but service doesn't matter too much as long as I can get my Foie Gras!
3617<>xx<>And much like most of the other best restaurants in Chinatown, Raku is open very late, until 2 am I believe.
3618<>xx<>So "it's getting late" isn't an excuse not to go here.
3619<>xx<>i am pretty picky when it comes to Japanese food (VERY picky).
3620<>xx<>I even gave Morimoto a 2star or was it one...amnesia).
3621<>xx<>But this place, Raku...oh wow!
3622<>xx<>Pure ecstasy... Probabaly ordered 15 items out of 25 and EVERYthing was superb.
3623<>xx<>One particular item: Uni soup, that itself was the highlight of my first evening that wknd.
3624<>xx<>The tofu...so simple yet heaven, i don't even like ginger but pairing with their homemade tofu and green onions, OMY...pallete re-organizing.
3625<>xx<>Ordered all types of balls/liver/hearts on a stick and boy did they deliver a symphony in my tummy.
3626<>xx<>Just get off the strip for a split second to this gem...no doubt the best tapas in town!
3627<>xx<>Very good food, great atmosphere, and service!
3628<>xx<>I went here with my family and friends  and the server was extremely helpful and recommended all the good stuff.
3629<>xx<>I had Foei gras which is super awesome!!!!
3630<>xx<>and we had fish and crab.
3631<>xx<>The good thing about the restaurant is that when you order one dish, they cooked it in a variety of different ways, and you'll end up getting more and more dishes coming.
3632<>xx<>The only reason I did not give them a 5 star is that I have to wait 20-40 mins for the dishes, definitely not a good restaurant to go if you are in a hurry.
3633<>xx<>But, overall two thumbs up!
3634<>xx<>been here 2 times now and both times they were equally amazing.
3635<>xx<>this last time i made a reservation for 4 ppl and it was funny because when you make a reservation they tell you that your party has 2.5 hours to dine and they hold your reservation for 15 mins past the reso time otherwise they give up the table.
3636<>xx<>anyhow arrived early and table was ready.
3637<>xx<>server came over right away and greeted from entire restaurant staff including sushi chef when we sat down.
3638<>xx<>server explained specials in detail and was quite knowledgeable about the sake list which was a nice surprise.
3639<>xx<>in fact we were debating between 3 sakes so she brought out a shot glass of each one and the bottle so we could try all 3. amazing touch of service that takes up time for the server and costs them $ but being all about service they still do that.
3640<>xx<>one of the best touches i have seen in quite a long time.
3641<>xx<>highly impressed.
3642<>xx<>server gave great recommendations about the food and they were all right on point.
3643<>xx<>poached egg with uni wow amazing!!!
3644<>xx<>scallop in butter great flavors slightly overcooked but still great dish.
3645<>xx<>age dashi tofu was terrific and they gave bowls and small spoons for all of us.
3646<>xx<>sashimi is some of the freshest in town in my eyes and ive been to most japanese restaurants in las vegas including high end ones on strip.
3647<>xx<>foie gras = one of the best things ive had in town hands down top 15 dishes in town.
3648<>xx<>but then again 3 of the other dishes are also foie from other restaurants.
3649<>xx<>all food was spectacular, they bring dishes out in a nice time frame so your not overwhelmed with food and the hot food wont get cold sitting on the table.
3650<>xx<>service was great, they filled up water glasses consistently which is one of the main things i look for in restaurants.
3651<>xx<>friendly service and they checked up on the table throughout the meal.
3652<>xx<>great job changing out plates when necessary and gave us all bowls and small spoons like i mentioned for certain courses such as the tofu course.
3653<>xx<>overall it was amazing and no they didnt kick us out after 2.5 hours.
3654<>xx<>definitely will go again soon.
3655<>xx<>side note they always say see you later when leaving some restaurants drop the check and thats it but not this one.
3656<>xx<>its the little things raku does and does right.
3657<>xx<>it was ok for me
3658<>xx<>Excellent food, fresh food.
3659<>xx<>My favorite was the blue fin tuna.
3660<>xx<>Delicious.
3661<>xx<>Make sure you make reservations.
3662<>xx<>I am a fanatic on Japanese food, after reading the reviews on Yelp about this place...
3663<>xx<>I decided to try it out on my short 3 day trip to Vegas.
3664<>xx<>This place is without a doubt the best Japanese BBQ I ever had.
3665<>xx<>Every dish is a surprise one after another, the deserts are heavenly too.
3666<>xx<>This place is actually so good that I went there again on the following night.
3667<>xx<>Thank god Raku is not located in one of those fancy hotels on the strip or else everything they sell would be double the price.
3668<>xx<>Raku should be synonymous with mastered the technique cooking.
3669<>xx<>True Japanese, true skill, and too tasty!
3670<>xx<>What you should good ranking:  1.
3671<>xx<>Yellow-tail 2.
3672<>xx<>Sashimi Salad 3.
3673<>xx<>Foie Gras Custard 4.
3674<>xx<>Home Made Tofu(half fried/natural) 5.
3675<>xx<>Kobe Beef Garlic  6.
3676<>xx<>Green Tea Creme Brulee 7.
3677<>xx<>Pork Ears 8.
3678<>xx<>Grilled Asparagus 9.
3679<>xx<>Grilled Mushroom 10.
3680<>xx<>Deep Fried Chicken
3681<>xx<>I was soooo excited when my friend took me to this place.
3682<>xx<>Its tradition japanese food thats done properly.
3683<>xx<>I love everything I have tried there, a little bit fushion but the chefs know what they are doing.
3684<>xx<>The quality and freshness of their fish is outstanding.
3685<>xx<>The presentation is good as well.
3686<>xx<>I love their homemade tofu, and Foie Gras.
3687<>xx<>The Salmon was probably a less impressive dish.
3688<>xx<>Good Sake collections also, I didn't like the taster sake menu that much simply because I already knew what I like.
3689<>xx<>I love this place!!!
3690<>xx<>Its expensive if you compare to local korean sushi places that use mayo to cover up the poor quality of fish.
3691<>xx<>But definitely way cheaper than the ones inside Casino.
3692<>xx<>I probably would go to this place as often as I can.. Yum..
3693<>xx<>THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!
3694<>xx<>my favorite Japanese restaurant in LV by far!!!
3695<>xx<>You have to make a reservation 3-4 days prior to your arrival.
3696<>xx<>When u enter the restaurant you immeditaly see the open sushi bar with a little peak hole window into the kitchen.
3697<>xx<>The hostess seated us at the bar, and quickly we were asked for our drinks.
3698<>xx<>I order anything and EVERYTHING on the menu that has uni in it.
3699<>xx<>if u get a chance, and u ARE AN UNI LOVER.
3700<>xx<>you MUST TRY THE PREMIUM UNI, its so cold, so sweet, and succulent..... its so good i can cry!
3701<>xx<>!lol  we ordered a vierty of grilled meats, such as the kobe beef with wasabi, the grilled pork ears, grilled froi gras (OMG!
3702<>xx<>MUST HAVE).. i ordered so much stuff i cant really remember everything.. but here's a few items on the menu i do remember being MUST HAVES ON THE MENU!!
3703<>xx<>:  PREMIUM UNI, LIVE UNI W/ SOBA NOODLES, FROI GRAS COLD SOBA, FROI GRAS CUSTARD, KOBE BEEF WASABAI & GARLIC, BLUE FIN TUNA (when in season), GRILLED FROI GRAS, AGADASHI TOFU 2 WAYS, LAMP CHOPS, KOBE BEEF TENDON.... almost everything on the menu was GREAT!
3704<>xx<>!
3705<>xx<>We ate here Father's Day night for dinner.
3706<>xx<>Got seated right away and the service remained outstanding all night.
3707<>xx<>The NBA finals were playing on all the TV's which seemed appropriate for the evening.
3708<>xx<>Our waitress was awesome.
3709<>xx<>Kept the drinks full all night, fast service and brought and tended to the check quickly.
3710<>xx<>We started with the nachos which were a big hit with the whole table.
3711<>xx<>All our burgers were good and cooked exactly how we ordered them.
3712<>xx<>Of all the sides the onion rings were the best.
3713<>xx<>I'd say the fries were just ok.
3714<>xx<>The milkshake on the other hand, very good!
3715<>xx<>Really enjoyed our meal, would return.
3716<>xx<>Stumbled across this burger joint after watching Love (great show by the way, even if you're not a huge Beatles fan).
3717<>xx<>What we ordered.
3718<>xx<>Kobe sliders:  Got three different mini sliders, all cooked different ways.
3719<>xx<>I requested medium, but two of them were close to being well-done, while one was done medium.
3720<>xx<>I couldn't even tell the difference between these burgers and regular burgers.
3721<>xx<>The one which was done correctly was tasty, but by the time I got to that one, I was already disappointed.
3722<>xx<>Lamb:  Definitely not what we expected, but that's a good thing.
3723<>xx<>It's worth trying as you get flavors you are not used to finding in a burger.
3724<>xx<>Onion Rings: No complaints here.
3725<>xx<>Noticed the Banh Mi burger on the menu.
3726<>xx<>Right out, the waiter recommended us to stay away.
3727<>xx<>Not sure what they were trying to accomplish here, but this is a bad representation if you are expecting geniuine Vietnamese sandwiches.
3728<>xx<>In the end, you get okay burgers for above average casino prices.
3729<>xx<>I had the "stripper burger", which I thought was going to be lettuce wrapped......It was a burnt patty, over shredded lettuce with cheese and a slice of tomato for $12, meeeh.
3730<>xx<>I also order the "Showgirl" cocktail, which I really HOPE they forgot the alcohol, because it was WEAK which a $12 cocktail SHOULD not be.
3731<>xx<>Hubby had the TexMex, which tasted decent and looked phenomenal.
3732<>xx<>Fries, were just fries.
3733<>xx<>I would take Red Robin's over theirs.
3734<>xx<>Whatever happened to that caged area they kept the tigers in before one attacked Roy?
3735<>xx<>Well, ironically enough, the old tiger habitat is home to BLT burger... so instead, the only biting I witnessed was me, into my juicy Tex-Mex burger.
3736<>xx<>It was an excellent burger - medium well certified angus beef, loaded with chili, jalapenos, avocado, salsa, jack cheese and sour cream.
3737<>xx<>It was so big, I had to eat it with a fork and knife, but it was still definitely a burger.
3738<>xx<>I was hesitant about eating at BLT Burger when my colleague told me about it...
3739<>xx<>I thought, "Great, another high-priced, over-rate Vegas joint."
3740<>xx<>I was pleasantly surprised.
3741<>xx<>BLT really hit the spot.
3742<>xx<>Menu has real quality man food.
3743<>xx<>Sweet tater fries and burger was top notch (really).
3744<>xx<>Shakes are worth sharing as you wont get a better one anywhere else.
3745<>xx<>A friend and I shared our first meal at BLT Burger, after a 6.5 hour flight that involved leaving the house at 5am.
3746<>xx<>Thus, a plate of bran flakes would've probably gotten a decent number of stars for the chance to be on the ground in Vegas after the trip.
3747<>xx<>Clearly, BLT Burger provided a better meal than bran flakes.
3748<>xx<>We got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of sweet potato fries and another shake (malibu/ pineapple/ something for her, espresso/ kahlua for me).
3749<>xx<>This was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.
3750<>xx<>The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.
3751<>xx<>Nothing super special, but still good.
3752<>xx<>The shakes were the highlight.
3753<>xx<>They were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.
3754<>xx<>I wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.
3755<>xx<>There was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.
3756<>xx<>Service was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from Vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and I'll round up for the happiness that I had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth.
3757<>xx<>had their mozzarella sticks and their bbq brisket burger and several drinks I could not remember at this point if I wanted to.
3758<>xx<>mozz sticks were good, not spectacular but above average.
3759<>xx<>bbq brisket burger was good  but WAS NOT a burger, it had NO HAMBURGER on it whatsoever.
3760<>xx<>They need to take this off the burger menu and call it a sandwich but as a sandwich was not bad at all, no where near the best ever but I was definitely let down by there being no hamburger.
3761<>xx<>I had the falafel burger, which was DELICIOUS.
3762<>xx<>The "skinny fries" aren't exactly skinny, but tasted good nonetheless.
3763<>xx<>Attentive service.
3764<>xx<>Centrally located on the strip.
3765<>xx<>I'm going back the next time I'm in Vegas.
3766<>xx<>Came here on a Monday night for dinner.
3767<>xx<>Prices seemed reasonable compared to the shi-shi restaurants around it.
3768<>xx<>I ordered a cider and a falafel burger.
3769<>xx<>It was a little dry but overall it was good.
3770<>xx<>Sucks that a $12 burger doesn't come with fries.
3771<>xx<>My friend got the buffalo chicken burger and a beer.
3772<>xx<>Overall it was good.
3773<>xx<>Looked over at the other table with sweet potato fries, onion rings and shoe string fries.
3774<>xx<>Couldn't really justify paying an extra five bucks for something that  normally comes with a burger.
3775<>xx<>My friend and I had racked up a whopping $45 on the penny machines while we waited for my friends who were hugging the toilets at the Mirage.
3776<>xx<>So we thought that the best way to spend the money would be to eat after hours :)  CPK was closed so we decided to eat here.
3777<>xx<>My friend was catching a cold and asked for hot tea - they didn't have tea - so they offered her hot water- mmmm now doesn't that sound tasty - she took it anyway...  Usually the foods you crave when intoxicated are not the healthiest - so what did we end up ordering: spicy chicken wings, fried dill pickles, jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, a strawberry milkshake, and onion rings.
3778<>xx<>I was surprised how good the fried pickles were - i am not a huge fan of pickles nor of fried food but this was particularly yummy.
3779<>xx<>Also the jalapeno poppers were one of the better one that i have tried.
3780<>xx<>They use the whole jalapeno and they don't load it with cream cheese.
3781<>xx<>The food was filling!
3782<>xx<>What a great way to end the night!!
3783<>xx<>[not so much a great morning though eating so much grease :) ]
3784<>xx<>This was my second visit to JR and wow were we blown away, again.
3785<>xx<>It was my boyfriends birthday so we flew out and were picked up in a gold MGM limo.
3786<>xx<>We walked through the "MGM Mansion" which is off limits to the public.
3787<>xx<>I guess it's only for the high rollers and guests of Joel Robuchon.
3788<>xx<>It's utterly incredible.
3789<>xx<>From beginning to end.
3790<>xx<>When we arrived we were seated at our favorite table.
3791<>xx<>The decor at this place is something out of a French palace.
3792<>xx<>We ordered the 5 course tasting menu.
3793<>xx<>The food looks small but oh boy do you get full.
3794<>xx<>By the third course we had to adjust our clothes.
3795<>xx<>Before your food is served they hall this bread cart to your table.
3796<>xx<>This bread cart is every bread lovers dream.
3797<>xx<>The cart had over 25 different breads, even the butter was delicious.
3798<>xx<>We enjoyed every course especially the truffled ravioli's and the duck breast with goose foie gras.
3799<>xx<>They have the best foie gras I have ever tasted.
3800<>xx<>I think goose foie gras is better than duck foie gras.
3801<>xx<>I put in a note for the maitre d to tell the waiter is was my boyfriends bday.
3802<>xx<>After dessert they brought my boyfriend this little white cake.
3803<>xx<>It was big enough for three people.
3804<>xx<>The cake was absolutely delicious.
3805<>xx<>It was the best cake of my life.
3806<>xx<>I think I want to celebrate every bday at Joel Robuchon.
3807<>xx<>After we finished his bday cake they wheeled out the dessert cart.
3808<>xx<>I already had a sugar comma from the cake but there was no way I was going to say no to that dessert cart.
3809<>xx<>There are desserts flown in from France and Switzerland but most of them are made there.
3810<>xx<>They are all so delicious.
3811<>xx<>This place is not cheap but it is definitely work every last cent.
3812<>xx<>Expect to pay $400+.
3813<>xx<>When you leave they give you a bag with a treat from the chef.
3814<>xx<>We received an amazing raspberry pistachio cake.
3815<>xx<>We devoured it with green tea the next morning.
3816<>xx<>I will be back every year.
3817<>xx<>I hope to visit the location in Paris someday.
3818<>xx<>Simply the best.
3819<>xx<>Get as many of the desserts from the cart as you want.
3820<>xx<>Tasting menu is ~$450, wine pairings at $300, $500, and $900.
3821<>xx<>Celebrated my 22nd birthday here and what an experience!
3822<>xx<>The staff was incredible, the sommelier was right on target and the food was absolutely exceptional!
3823<>xx<>I think the French got it right - butter, butter, butter!
3824<>xx<>And of course champagne, caviar, truffles and scallops!
3825<>xx<>FOOD OF THE GODS!
3826<>xx<>One of the best meals I've had in my life.
3827<>xx<>I love inspired French food, and Joel Robuchon served me some of the most delicious I have had.
3828<>xx<>My brother and I opted for the 7 course meal with wine pairing.
3829<>xx<>I'm sad we didn't have the patience for the 16 course, but we might have just died right there in the restaurant after experiencing one of the most powerful waves of food coma in my life.
3830<>xx<>The small palate opener of caviar and crab was absolutely delightful.
3831<>xx<>Highlights would be the uni and langostine, super fresh, very sweet and succulent.
3832<>xx<>The braised veal cheek was melt in your mouth.
3833<>xx<>The duck and fois gras were superbly executed.
3834<>xx<>Also had this savory lettuce veloute soup, which they pour into your bowl tableside.
3835<>xx<>The sommelier and servers provided top notch service.
3836<>xx<>They even go back and warm up your bread after you select from the huge bread cart.
3837<>xx<>Suffice it to say, the meal cost an arm and a leg, perhaps all four limbs.
3838<>xx<>But it's some of the best food I've ever eaten.
3839<>xx<>This is one of the 2 best meals of my life (I'd give it 10 stars if I could).
3840<>xx<>Been here twice for an 8 course tasting menu in the tasting room.
3841<>xx<>The tasting room decor is dark, intimate and fantastic, but you're only getting in there if you go with a big group, which I highly recommend.
3842<>xx<>I also recommend getting there a little early before your meal so you can enjoy a drink in the lounge--it's like being in a friend's very fancy, yet very comfortable, parlor.
3843<>xx<>The food cannot be described as anything other than pure perfection.
3844<>xx<>The taste, the presentation, the service, it is all exquisite.
3845<>xx<>Trying to select the best dish of the meal is like trying to pick your favorite child.
3846<>xx<>But if I had to choose, the 1st course caviar with crab meat and fennel cream would be the first-born, medical school-bound, 3 sport athlete son of the group.
3847<>xx<>The Michelin guide got it right, this place is absolutely deserving of that exclusive 3rd star.
3848<>xx<>PS: apparently yelp etiquette dictates that I add my lifetime Michelin star count?
3849<>xx<>In that case, Joel Robuchon = Michelin stars: 13-15 & 27-29 for me.
3850<>xx<>(I'm not being sarcastic, this is actually a great thing to keep track of...I'm going to put them all in a chart on my tombstone.)
3851<>xx<>This place has been on my bucket list for so long.
3852<>xx<>From the outside the restaurant looks so much bigger than it is.
3853<>xx<>Very intimate setting, booths on the corners of the room, a small patio area, and a few tables.
3854<>xx<>When dinner can cost close to $1000 for 2 I guess they don't need much seating.
3855<>xx<>With all the hype, I really didn't want to be disappointed.
3856<>xx<>This was to be my first 3 michelin star experience, and it was everything I imagined it to be and more.
3857<>xx<>I won't go over all the courses since many yelpers I'm sure have done that and in great detail with pictures to match.
3858<>xx<>Service though was not pretentious like I thought it would be, although the maitre d' was French so maybe he came off just a liiiitle bit, but hey he's French right?
3859<>xx<>We had many people helping us at different times so it was hard to discern who exactly was in charge of what but everything was explained and presented and timed perfectly.
3860<>xx<>Each course was brought at the exact right time and service was impeccable.
3861<>xx<>Bread cart was amazing, so many to choose from that I was glad that the server just told us they would bring an assortment out.
3862<>xx<>Even the butter was amazing with the extra virgin olive oil.
3863<>xx<>Portions were great, plating was beautiful, even the glassware and dishes they used were things I have never seen before.
3864<>xx<>Petit fours cart was awesome as well after dessert, I just wish I had more room to eat them all.
3865<>xx<>One thing that I HAVE to mention that I did think was funny though was that there was a picture of Al Gore in the restaurant that my date thought could be him, but  then figured it was a picture of Joel Robuchon at a younger age.
3866<>xx<>When we asked one of the servers if it was Al Gore he said yes.
3867<>xx<>We figured his picture was there because he was a frequent diner, but no.
3868<>xx<>The server said one day he came in and the picture was just there, along with a picture of a young Dustin Hoffman.
3869<>xx<>They both have never dined before and weren't regulars so he said he had no idea why those pictures were there or where they came from.
3870<>xx<>I guess if you're Joel Robuchon and you want to put pictures of random celebrities in your restaurant you can do it, because dammit you are the French chef of the century so you can do whatever you want.
3871<>xx<>We found it hilarious and had a loud chuckle at the table including the server.
3872<>xx<>I think it made people uncomfortable around us.
3873<>xx<>So I guess 5 stars for me, even if I have to dock some points for the 2 pictures, but everything besides that was perfect.
3874<>xx<>I also asked for an extra book that they give you of all the courses you had with pictures and descriptions, I didn't want to have to fight my date to the death on who gets to keep it.
3875<>xx<>I wouldn't be afraid to ask, they're very accommodating.
3876<>xx<>If you haven't been, you must, I have been multiple times both to L'atalier and To this high indexing restaurant.
3877<>xx<>You won't find a better prepared team, and more tasteful menu, and a better ambiance in the world.
3878<>xx<>Serious diners only, bring your pocketbook, this is a World Class Dining experience.
3879<>xx<>I have done the tasting menu and have hosted a 14 course Krug dinner.
3880<>xx<>All of the experiences I have had are top notch.
3881<>xx<>The bar at Roubochon, just off the entrance to the left is the best kept secret for an amazing cocktail in the US.
3882<>xx<>Bon appetit!
3883<>xx<>My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work.
3884<>xx<>He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.
3885<>xx<>Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful.
3886<>xx<>A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion.
3887<>xx<>The decor of the restaurant was beautiful.
3888<>xx<>Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine.
3889<>xx<>The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment "I think you'll find these more in your.. price range"  record scratch.
3890<>xx<>uhm, excuse me?!
3891<>xx<>Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways.
3892<>xx<>We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.
3893<>xx<>Then came time for dessert.
3894<>xx<>During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc.
3895<>xx<>We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon.
3896<>xx<>I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us.
3897<>xx<>Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..
3898<>xx<>Overall the food itself was really really spectacular.
3899<>xx<>The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite.
3900<>xx<>However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing.
3901<>xx<>We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.
3902<>xx<>The restaurant seemed out of place at MGM.
3903<>xx<>It would have been better suited at an upscale casino like Aria, Wynn, or Bellagio.
3904<>xx<>But, we went there anyway.
3905<>xx<>The presentations were amazing.
3906<>xx<>I can see over paying for food combinations, expertise, art, etc.
3907<>xx<>But, the drinks were also way overpriced.
3908<>xx<>It was 30-40% more expensive for scotch than getting identical drink at a bar 100 yds away.
3909<>xx<>Wine list was exceptional.
3910<>xx<>Many quality half bottle selections.
3911<>xx<>It was excellent.
3912<>xx<>But, not flawless.
3913<>xx<>They forgot our cheese course after we ordered it!
3914<>xx<>Food was amazing, but overall, not worth the investment.
3915<>xx<>Amazing food, just not worth $300 a head before drinks.
3916<>xx<>I would rather eat 3 times a another premium restaurant.
3917<>xx<>Disappointed.
3918<>xx<>There is absolutely no reason to go to Joel Robuchon unless you're curious about what it's like to spend a lot of money for hit-or-miss food and service that does not resemble a 3-star Michelin restaurant in the slightest.
3919<>xx<>I've eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon in both Paris and LV.
3920<>xx<>I very much enjoyed both experiences.
3921<>xx<>I didn't feel like I over-spent for those experiences.
3922<>xx<>In fairness, I knew ahead of time that spending $435 for a 16-course tasting menu would probably be disappointing, because how could it not?
3923<>xx<>It's $435 for a meal.
3924<>xx<>I was, however, hoping I might find something over the course of 3 hours to justify it.
3925<>xx<>The food: Within the 16 courses, I enjoyed the Le Caviar trio, the La Saint-Jacques (pan seared sea scallop), the Les Crustaces trio (crab and sea urchin, and I didn't actually like the sea urchin dish), Le Boeuf, and both desserts.
3926<>xx<>My sea bass was overcooked, and the foie gras in broth was one of the worst preparations of foie gras I've tasted; it was umami done wrong.
3927<>xx<>(L'Atelier has much better preparations.)
3928<>xx<>The bread and sweets were pretty good, however.
3929<>xx<>But for $435 I should be lauding this place.
3930<>xx<>I had a better tasting menu at The Pass (non-Michelin rated) in Houston, and a better experience with service.
3931<>xx<>The service: It made me question the last time Joel Robuchon was reviewed by the Michelin Guide.
3932<>xx<>There was no finesse or fluidity to service.
3933<>xx<>I was privy to loud whispers between waitstaff.
3934<>xx<>The bread tray was constantly hitting the back of where I was sitting on its way to-and-fro.
3935<>xx<>And, to top it off, when a waiter picked up the signed check from the patron to my left (who, admittedly, got a little snippy with waitstaff), I could see him roll his eyes and huff upon looking at the check.
3936<>xx<>As a diner, I should not see any of this at any Michelin rated restaurant, let alone a 3-star.
3937<>xx<>Look, all this Michelin star restaurant stuff can get  pretentious.
3938<>xx<>I keep exclaiming about it because I'm beginning to think the emperor has no clothes with a lot of these restaurants.
3939<>xx<>In particular, Joel Robuchon.
3940<>xx<>But I would go to either L'Atelier again.
3941<>xx<>I'm a local, I tell people to go here.
3942<>xx<>I love the downstairs motif!
3943<>xx<>I also love the fact that you can bop around the Palazzo, drink & gamble, then go to dinner and the club all in the same place.
3944<>xx<>Eating here is like the start of your night, puts you in the right mood.
3945<>xx<>staff is super nice too!
3946<>xx<>always nice bouncers here, will escort you to the ladies as you push yourself through the hoards of people.
3947<>xx<>Bunch of old guys Really small club They open at 10:30 for the record not 10:28 (those were the kind of comments some of the door men were saying) Overpriced for a club that will be closed by 2013 for sure  Too many other options in Vegas to settle for this place
3948<>xx<>I did not stay for the club but I had dinner and I really enjoyed it.
3949<>xx<>The food was awesome and the service was exceptional.
3950<>xx<>We went on a Sunday night and we ordered a few bottles for bottle service.
3951<>xx<>The club was pretty small and stuffy.
3952<>xx<>Our cocktail server was supposed to stay with our group and pour drinks for us the whole night, but instead left and came back and forth.
3953<>xx<>We were paying a lot of money, and it would be nice to have the server at least stay at our table and keep pouring our drinks.
3954<>xx<>It wasn't that busy for her to be gone majority of the time.
3955<>xx<>I feel like a hillbilly!
3956<>xx<>This is my first time back to Vegas after 8 yr. Crazy!
3957<>xx<>"Wow it so big,Ma " and real purty.
3958<>xx<>How do I rate the restaurant on food service, location or decor?
3959<>xx<>Food wAs average,  the wait for a table inside was an hour, the location and view on the hot patio was amazing but itS 90° at night and too hot to eat.
3960<>xx<>The decor is supposed to be a Turkish bath leading up to the club on the second flooR.
3961<>xx<>Cool bar nice lounge.
3962<>xx<>I hear its a small intimate club but nice.
3963<>xx<>But wez here to eatz.
3964<>xx<>So, my friend lives here and says they're known for their balls.
3965<>xx<>Huge meatballs!
3966<>xx<>!!
3967<>xx<>Really with the heat we were full with that and the yummy garlic bread.
3968<>xx<>It was a huge 4" meatball with Italian grown toMatos.
3969<>xx<>Its just large not that tasty.
3970<>xx<>I prefer small and tasty cuz really size isn't everything.
3971<>xx<>Then I had eggplant rigatoni.
3972<>xx<>H'm whatever a little over salty a little dry and like most Italian I feel I make better at home.
3973<>xx<>Prices are reasonable, meatball with whipped ricotta $20.
3974<>xx<>Rigatoni $24.
3975<>xx<>Waiter was nice.
3976<>xx<>The benefit of sitting outside waS watching the cheesy.
3977<>xx<>siren show at the TI.
3978<>xx<>it seemed very similar to the pirate battle.
3979<>xx<>We were too full to eat our food, so we asked them to box it.
3980<>xx<>Remember my friend lives here.
3981<>xx<>The buss boy not understanding, since he's esl, stacked our food and tossed it.
3982<>xx<>We only had two bites literally.
3983<>xx<>So the waiter says sorry, it's tossed.
3984<>xx<>If you want to wait it'll be a while.
3985<>xx<>OKAY.
3986<>xx<>We'll wait.
3987<>xx<>I'm still drinking my champagne anyways.
3988<>xx<>So they prepared both all over so he can have leftovers.
3989<>xx<>;) I thought it was funny.
3990<>xx<>The waiter was cool about it.
3991<>xx<>Food taste average, but overall experience adds an extra gold star.
3992<>xx<>I went out on a Sunday night to LAVO and it is a beautiful venue, it was a perfect place for my friend and I to start our Vegas trip.
3993<>xx<>The music was great and the crowd was just right.
3994<>xx<>No hassle at the door plenty of seating.
3995<>xx<>All was going well until my friends purse was stolen.... needless to say that the staff at LAVO was extremely attentive to our needs and searched for the missing items right next to us without any sort of attitude or annoyance.
3996<>xx<>They also helped us out the next night to have a good time.
3997<>xx<>If you are looking for a venue where you can have a drink, dance and not get bumped into every 5 seconds I would recommend this place.
3998<>xx<>**We did go on a Sunday night so I don't know what the vibe is like on a Friday or Saturday.
3999<>xx<>CliffsNotes:  Intimate dinner settings but nothing out of the ordinary for an Italian restaurant.
4000<>xx<>If you're looking to impress a dinner date, Lavo will do the trick.
4001<>xx<>If you're looking to impress a foodie, then consider one of the many other restaurants around town.
4002<>xx<>See Craig R.'s review that sums up the rest of our group meal.
4003<>xx<>[Original Visit: November 7, 2010]
4004<>xx<>This is a review for the club only.
4005<>xx<>I definitely give Lavo bonus points, because I once met a guy there named Elvis (checked his driver's license).
4006<>xx<>You can't buy such an experience!
4007<>xx<>On my most recent visit, it was unbearably crowded, but I'm not sure it's fair to fault a club for that.
4008<>xx<>The crowd itself is quite friendly, and everyone is having a good time.
4009<>xx<>Be careful if you're really drunk or wearing very high heels (high probability for that in Vegas), because you have to go up quite a bit of stairs to get into the club area.
4010<>xx<>This was the the for the Las Vegas RNR marathon after party and it definitely didn`t disappoint!!
4011<>xx<>Those of us that had our VIP passes (from the race) skipped the wait in line and got right in.
4012<>xx<>Three levels of Lavo.
4013<>xx<>First one being the bar with cushy seatings and small cozy tables, packed of course.
4014<>xx<>Second level more small tables ( Lavo is an Italian restaurant and night club).
4015<>xx<>Third level, club area-packed, and really small.
4016<>xx<>Kind of hard to walk through but we did have a blast over all!!
4017<>xx<>I kept hearing about their ragu with big balls (as in meatballs) and decided on my next visit to try them, everyone keeps raving about these balls!
4018<>xx<>!
4019<>xx<>Made a 6:30pm Rez and were taken right to our table.
4020<>xx<>We chose the balcony seating.
4021<>xx<>Nice view of the strip and the treasure island pirate show.
4022<>xx<>I ordered the ceaser salad ($17!)
4023<>xx<>and the husband got the pasta carbonana, very good and enough for us to share.
4024<>xx<>We ordered and the food came out in literally less than 5 mins.
4025<>xx<>Good food and reasonable price!
4026<>xx<>Texas de Brazil is amazing!
4027<>xx<>The staff is very attentive and friendly.
4028<>xx<>The food is delicious.
4029<>xx<>The meats are tender and have great flavor.
4030<>xx<>They also have a salad bar that has everything you would ever want.
4031<>xx<>Everything is fresh and well stocked.
4032<>xx<>We have eaten here a dozen times and have never been disappointed.
4033<>xx<>Go try it, I am sure you will agree.
4034<>xx<>There is no question that this is really my favorite restaurant!
4035<>xx<>The food and service are usually fantastic.
4036<>xx<>I recently got sick after eating there, but to be honest it was really because I couldn't stop myself and ended up over eating.
4037<>xx<>So if you can manage better self-control than I did in my recent visit, and you love meat, then this too may become your favorite restaurant!
4038<>xx<>Recently in LV for a convention.
4039<>xx<>We took our sales reps there last year and it worked out well, so we returned this year.
4040<>xx<>I have always had a wonderful experience at T de B in Texas or LV.
4041<>xx<>Wonderful salad bar and the meats are perfect.
4042<>xx<>The service once you are there (Party of 15) is very good and they go out of their way to take care of everyone.
4043<>xx<>I always run into the same problem of OVER EATING.
4044<>xx<>What prevented me from giving this place a 5 star rating was the reservation process.
4045<>xx<>Google and 411 has published a wrong number, so you couldn't call in.
4046<>xx<>Even if you got the number from their website, the hostess is not in until 2pm, so you leave a message; follow up on messages to confirm reservation was not very good.
4047<>xx<>This place is solid.
4048<>xx<>I had never had a meal like this.
4049<>xx<>Fresh meat just keeps on coming.
4050<>xx<>It is pricey for 4 of us it was $235.
4051<>xx<>With that being said I would eat here again.
4052<>xx<>I really liked the chicken and Filet mignon.
4053<>xx<>Been wanting to go to Texas de Brazil for quite awhile but it's on the expensive side so just never got around to it.
4054<>xx<>Finally went for my birthday and had a wonderful time and one of the best meals I've ever had.
4055<>xx<>Everything I love about a great steakhouse (extensive salad bar and garlic mashed potatoes mmmmm) but you get a wide variety of different meats and they'll keep bringing them around as long as you still have room.
4056<>xx<>All the meats were perfectly cooked, the chicken and pork cuts were juicy and tender.
4057<>xx<>We finished the meal with a slice of Brazilian cheesecake, which was a perfect combination of chocolate fudge, cheesecake and caramel.
4058<>xx<>Cannot wait to come back here again now that I know all the little things about it.
4059<>xx<>Definitely want to try some of the sauces they had at the salad bar with the meat (chimichurri and mint sauce).
4060<>xx<>Important tip!
4061<>xx<>: if your planning on going for your first time or just a return trip, sign up on their website for their eclub/mailing list.
4062<>xx<>They'll send you a 10% off coupon for the entire meal and they'll send you a "Buy one, get one dinner free" for your birthday.
4063<>xx<>With the buy one, get one coupon, our check ended up being $100 plus the tip.
4064<>xx<>We had an amazing meal and alcoholic beverages and dessert.
4065<>xx<>Very much worth it.
4066<>xx<>I have been here quite a few times and enjoyed every trip.
4067<>xx<>The staff is friendly, and I have run into one not so friendly server, but Im not going to shout over one time.
4068<>xx<>People do have bad days : ) The salad bar is great, and the meat I give 4 stars.
4069<>xx<>I enjoy the bacon wrapped chicken and filet mignon the most.
4070<>xx<>I personally dont care for the rest but that I know is personal taste.
4071<>xx<>Im sure their is better steaks out their but for an all you can eat its terrific.
4072<>xx<>There is usually little wait on anything, and the dessert is also a must try no matter the choice.
4073<>xx<>Yes, its high in price, but lets face it, your eating large sums of MEAT!
4074<>xx<>If price is an issue, go to applebees and call it a day, no harm no foul.
4075<>xx<>If you want to eat large sums of good meat, enjoy a great salad bar that should never be compared to sweet tomato, and enjoy a different dining experience, come here.
4076<>xx<>The lobster bisque is good but not as amazing as other people have said.
4077<>xx<>I am also a harsh judge I am from New England.
4078<>xx<>Service was great, the salad bar was fantastic.
4079<>xx<>My favorite were the little cheese pop-over thingies that appeared at our table.
4080<>xx<>I was so excited to go here that my expectations went a bit too high.
4081<>xx<>I think an actually requirement of working here is to be from Brazil.
4082<>xx<>I wonder how that exactly works out... All the meat that we tried was really delicious however a lot of the times it was extremely rare.
4083<>xx<>I like my meat a bit more cooked and when I asked for medium it was like they suddenly avoided our table.
4084<>xx<>The buffet didn't match the cost of the meal.
4085<>xx<>For that price they should be bringing all the food to me.
4086<>xx<>Over all I dont think I would go back.
4087<>xx<>Food Orgasm - seriously.
4088<>xx<>I could have lived off the salad bar and been completely happy, but once the carne started landing on my plate, I got an erection.
4089<>xx<>The flank steak melts in your mouth, the sirloin house special made love to my taste buds, the fillet then jumped in and wanted a threesome.
4090<>xx<>The garlic sirloin made my mouth water,,,wait strike that,,,,,my mouth wasn't watering, but crying tears of joy.
4091<>xx<>Oh if we had a TdB in San Diego, I would eat there every weekend.
4092<>xx<>I guess I will just have to settle for the real thing when i fly to Rio next week.
4093<>xx<>Texas de Brazil is a great date spot.
4094<>xx<>Make love to your taste buds, then go home and make love to each other.
4095<>xx<>Whew.....now I need a cigarette.
4096<>xx<>AMAZING!
4097<>xx<>I was skeptical about the high price and all you can eat steak.
4098<>xx<>I have been to many buffets and many steakhouses and I have learned one true fact; you get what you pay for.
4099<>xx<>I ate 5 fillets and they were each among the best I have ever had.
4100<>xx<>Tender, juicy, and full of flavor, these fillets were outstanding.
4101<>xx<>The hot and cold salad bar was full of choices.
4102<>xx<>I am a meat and potatoes guy but my wife was thrilled with all the green and good for you stuff.
4103<>xx<>My favorites were the mashed potatoe, the potatoes au gratin, and the sautéed mushrooms.
4104<>xx<>The service was spectacular!
4105<>xx<>We really felt like we were taken care of.
4106<>xx<>With the price as high as it is, this is truly a once in a while event, but oh what an event!
4107<>xx<>I stop by the place with my pup on the days when we make a trip back to California.
4108<>xx<>I've been getting their croissant sandwich, a muffin (lemon poppyseed if they have it) usually a chai tea latte.
4109<>xx<>Their croissant sandwich is delicious.
4110<>xx<>When I first ordered this, I wasn't sure what to expect - I thought I would be just getting fried eggs on a croissant, which is fine, I love eggs.
4111<>xx<>Their croissant wich has egg, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and a bit of mayo.
4112<>xx<>So good!
4113<>xx<>I love their lemon poppy seed muffin, and having tried their banana nut muffin, just as yummy.
4114<>xx<>The top of the muffin has that crispy right from the oven texture.
4115<>xx<>A total perk is that my pup gets a doggy treat sometimes!
4116<>xx<>Love that they are vegetarian and vegan friendly and are also animal lovers!
4117<>xx<>A good alternative to Starbucks.
4118<>xx<>Ok, so some are telling me this is a vegetarian and vegan hangout...and i am too fond of steak, seafood, chicken, etc...to even consider switching to a vegan menu.
4119<>xx<>Who cares(!
4120<>xx<>)...this place is primarily for coffee and tea drinkers.
4121<>xx<>If that apeals to you...this local secret is now on the map, so do yourself a flavor and do check this one out soon.
4122<>xx<>Great place to grab coffee with a friend or with your laptop- wifi is free, hallelujah!
4123<>xx<>Ask the barista for the password, seems to change frequently.
4124<>xx<>Love how this place also has a patio- would be great in the spring.
4125<>xx<>For now, in the winter, I guess it's a haven for smokers.
4126<>xx<>Had the nutella special coffee- very, very sweet.
4127<>xx<>Unable to finish it.
4128<>xx<>The white chocolate raspberry scone was delightful though- it looked a little misshapen but tasted great, and it was one of the only things they had left in the pastry case.
4129<>xx<>Either they sell out fast or they don't make much, so maybe not a great place to go hungry.
4130<>xx<>Easily one of the best coffee shops in town.
4131<>xx<>It is the best one if you like your drinks without dairy.
4132<>xx<>They're extremely helpful through their accommodation of your special requests and general knowledgeably of pretty much everything on their menu.
4133<>xx<>They have tons of sweetener and non-dairy options to suit your tastes.
4134<>xx<>Everything tastes great!
4135<>xx<>It's that small, indie coffee shop that you wish was where ever you were.
4136<>xx<>Yes, wifi is a must - and is accounted for.
4137<>xx<>Spend some time here and leave happy.
4138<>xx<>Great little coffee shop!
4139<>xx<>I enjoyed the Creme Brulee Iced Latte.
4140<>xx<>Wonderful!
4141<>xx<>They have a wide variety of drinks.
4142<>xx<>It's always nice to support a local business vs. the regular chains.
4143<>xx<>Sunrise is just as good and hopefully be back soon!
4144<>xx<>So friendly and helpful!
4145<>xx<>What a staff and what a concept.
4146<>xx<>Vegetarian friendly if not encouraged.
4147<>xx<>The only thing missing for me are chess players.
4148<>xx<>I love a blitz game with my coffee.
4149<>xx<>But def try this spot and maybe the fire and brimstone spiced coffee if you feel adventurous, it rocks.
4150<>xx<>They are so ahead of the game, they even accept bitcoin :)
4151<>xx<>Visit date 3/22/11  Now this is what a coffee shop is supposed to be!
4152<>xx<>Amazing hand pulled espresso with a crema so perfect you didn't need any sugar.
4153<>xx<>Awesome drip coffee too, although once I tasted the espresso, I had extreme order envy.
4154<>xx<>Oh well, when I return to Lost Wages I will definitely hit this place up again for an espresso.
4155<>xx<>The only thing missing was a selection of breakfast pastries.
4156<>xx<>If they'd been out I would've gotten one as I was starved.
4157<>xx<>The coffee here is unique in that there is that organic, soil-based, bitterness that comes through with the coffee.
4158<>xx<>It's almost like having dark chocolate compared to milk chocolate.
4159<>xx<>It's like drinking coffee in a really pure form.
4160<>xx<>I tried the hazelnut latte and liked it a ton.
4161<>xx<>There's a subtle flavor of hazelnut that does not overwhelm the unique quality of the coffee by itself.
4162<>xx<>Worth a try for sure.
4163<>xx<>I was introduced to Sunrise Coffee by a friend of mine.
4164<>xx<>We'll just call him Shmorey Smurratt.
4165<>xx<>The most hipstering, skinny jean wearin, never heard of his music havin, indie book readin, fingerless glove using, riding a bike to school, taking close up pictures in weird angles, film school student being, messy hair and beard having, thrift store shoppin and super elitist i know.
4166<>xx<>Well, he told me this place was good.
4167<>xx<>I tried it.
4168<>xx<>He was right.
4169<>xx<>Vegan Alien Burrito is the only thing I eat for lunch 365 days a year.
4170<>xx<>I'm giving it 4 stars to start...they will have to work for he fifth star but they will get it.
4171<>xx<>Sam Fox borders on "genius" and True Food is another masterful creation.
4172<>xx<>The look...it's brash, fresh and it erased 5 years off my age.
4173<>xx<>The vibe....well knows how to get the buzz in the community.
4174<>xx<>Bathrooms....well he takes attention to detail about as far as you can take it at this point.
4175<>xx<>By the way, True Food looks like it defies the recession and rightfully so.
4176<>xx<>Positive Vibe.
4177<>xx<>Kudos to you Sam.
4178<>xx<>Oh yes, the food.
4179<>xx<>Well, it's a "healthy" offering, so I thought...could taste like so much of healthy food, bland, boring and I usually have to go to Jack in the Box and order 2 tacos to feel full.
4180<>xx<>This is NOT case.
4181<>xx<>I had the Turkey Burger.
4182<>xx<>It was downright astonishingly flavorful and filling.
4183<>xx<>The turkey was zestful and spicy.
4184<>xx<>I was pleasantly surprised.
4185<>xx<>Add to that, the side salad with Tuscan Kale....like a first kiss.
4186<>xx<>Anyway, will be there for dinner this week and the fifth star is probably earned on that trip.
4187<>xx<>Again, Sam....you had me at "hello".
4188<>xx<>Well, here it is...my first review.
4189<>xx<>The Good: Incredibly friendly staff.
4190<>xx<>Everyone from the hostess to the bartender were great!
4191<>xx<>Wish they hired people like them everywhere.
4192<>xx<>The Bad: The reason that I know they are all so nice was that it took at least 45 minutes to be seated.
4193<>xx<>Allowing enough time to meet everyone who has even thought about applying there.
4194<>xx<>The Good: The food was good as well as being fairly healthy.
4195<>xx<>The Bad: No matter how many ways it can be prepared, Kale(sp?)
4196<>xx<>is never going to be a part of my diet.
4197<>xx<>Overall, If you don't mind waiting for trendy Cafeteria's with better food then your old high school, this is the place for you!!
4198<>xx<>Very much the place to be right now.
4199<>xx<>I'm happy I went and it wasn't bad for one dinner but won't be going back anytime soon.
4200<>xx<>I am however, officially convinced that the restaurant is better then this review....
4201<>xx<>I have been here several times now.
4202<>xx<>A very healthy place to come to eat.
4203<>xx<>The food is wonderful and very fresh.
4204<>xx<>Nice and modern decor as well.
4205<>xx<>The only down side is it is very expensive i think.
4206<>xx<>But it is in the Biltmore so that ups the price.
4207<>xx<>You can have your car valeted, or park in yourself in the nice cool parking Garage in the back.
4208<>xx<>I opted for that.
4209<>xx<>It was started by Dr. Andrew Weil and the first time i went there with my friend Kris, he was sitting right next to us at a table.
4210<>xx<>It is a very nice place to go when you want to have a lovely relaxing lunch and really enjoy yourself.
4211<>xx<>If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles.
4212<>xx<>A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable.
4213<>xx<>A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out.
4214<>xx<>Yay!
4215<>xx<>Amazingly fresh and delicious with lots of gluten free options.
4216<>xx<>The natural beef and black rice stir fry was outrageous (not gluten free).
4217<>xx<>My wife had the Panang Curry and based on the rapturous look on her face, she enjoyed hers as well.
4218<>xx<>I went here one rare freezing night after our pilates class and it was even better than I had anticipated after reading reviews on Yelp and checking out their menu.
4219<>xx<>Started with the hummus and asked for some veggies instead of pita (saving those calories).
4220<>xx<>Instead of the standard tasteless carrots and celery, they brought us a bowl of mixed baby carrots (different colors and fresh), barely steamed broccoli, baby tomatoes, squash, pickles - I could have made a meal out of that, but then we dipped them in the hummus...heavenly.
4221<>xx<>One friend got the lasagna and was in raptures.
4222<>xx<>The other got the salmon, and told me it was her third time ordering it because it was so amazing.
4223<>xx<>Their homemade "soda" was good enough to consider it dessert.
4224<>xx<>We shared a kale salad, and it was simple and delicious.
4225<>xx<>I had the sea bass and can honestly say I have never had better.
4226<>xx<>It was on a bed of roasted cauliflower, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts.
4227<>xx<>I practically licked the plate clean.
4228<>xx<>All sustainably grown, organic, well-prepared, and delivered with expertise.
4229<>xx<>The waitstaff was efficient, pleasant, helpful, and not hovering.
4230<>xx<>I will be back again, maybe even this week.
4231<>xx<>Sooooooo good.
4232<>xx<>I was recommended Truefoods by a foodie friend of mine and decided to finally try it Sunday for brunch.
4233<>xx<>I went along with another friend who likes to eat just as much as I.
4234<>xx<>We were seated outside as requested in no more than 5 minutes at a 4-top, which is always a pleasant surprise.
4235<>xx<>I started off with a Moscow mule.
4236<>xx<>The waiter came back out and said they did not have ginger beer and said he could recreate it with fresh ginger and such.
4237<>xx<>It was even better than expected.
4238<>xx<>We split 3 entrees: spaghetti squash casserole, mushroom flatbread and shaved turkey.
4239<>xx<>Everything was excellent.
4240<>xx<>They even split the entrees up for us.
4241<>xx<>Highly recommend coming here if you like good service and good eats.
4242<>xx<>We had a decent lunch here, but not good enough that I'll be back any time soon.
4243<>xx<>For an app, we had something that was like a carmelized onion and goat cheese pizza which was very good.
4244<>xx<>For my entree, I had the butternut squash ravioli, and it tasted very "earthy".
4245<>xx<>The service was decent.
4246<>xx<>Very good food.
4247<>xx<>Everything is fresh and tasty.
4248<>xx<>The service is fast and friendly.
4249<>xx<>I am a big fan of the watermelon heirloom tomato salad and the seasonal market salads.
4250<>xx<>My only complaint is that they are a little expensive.
4251<>xx<>I wish there were more places like True Food that offered genuinely delicious and healthy food.
4252<>xx<>The prices are too high to eat here regularly like other take out places.
4253<>xx<>This is a once in a while splurge, but I wish I could eat like this every night!
4254<>xx<>Good stuff.
4255<>xx<>Great atmosphere.
4256<>xx<>Unique menu with plenty of great options for herbivores or carnivores.
4257<>xx<>brunch was amazing
4258<>xx<>Best meal in Scottsdale!!
4259<>xx<>Try the appetizers less expensive than the entree and tasty!
4260<>xx<>!
4261<>xx<>My husband has been raving about this place, so we went there for lunch.
4262<>xx<>We started with their guacamole, made fresh right at the table.
4263<>xx<>It was incredible.
4264<>xx<>They come to your table with a cart loaded with bowls of ingredients and you can choose what to add to your guacamole.
4265<>xx<>I've never had anything so delicious!
4266<>xx<>Wow!
4267<>xx<>Their chips were also the best I've had in any restaurant anywhere!
4268<>xx<>We each ordered the tacos.
4269<>xx<>I had the pork shoulder tacos, which were incredible.
4270<>xx<>My husband ordered the barbacoa tacos.
4271<>xx<>He said they were good, but we swapped one taco and he liked the pork shoulder better.
4272<>xx<>I also had one of their "famous margaritas" and it was really tasty!
4273<>xx<>It was just the right strength, not too weak, not too strong.
4274<>xx<>We will definitely be going back.
4275<>xx<>My only complaint was it's SO hot sitting outside on the patio, but I'm from Seattle, so not used to the heat.
4276<>xx<>It was like a sauna, so if you're really sensitive to heat, stay inside if you can.
4277<>xx<>Definitely five star, will definitely be back.
4278<>xx<>i came here for dinner the other day while in town and although i had a great dinner here...the only thing that really stood out was the dessert i had....its the only thing that im writing the review on.
4279<>xx<>sat down at the bar for a bite and to watch the world series game...had some drinks.
4280<>xx<>had tacos.
4281<>xx<>wanted something sweet...so i ordered dessert.
4282<>xx<>FML.
4283<>xx<>MIND BLOWING DESSERT ALERT.
4284<>xx<>we've all had churros at some point and time in our lives right...its kinda like eating a donut really...when its fresh, its amazing.
4285<>xx<>fried, sweet, and tastes like cinnamon...cant go wrong...  i USED to think this UNTIL i had the churros here at the Mission.
4286<>xx<>they serve up these mini churros here WITH a tres leches milkshake/ice cream that will make a grown man cry tears of joy.
4287<>xx<>i mean, im over there taking bites and barely able to control my emotions...knowing that i dont live in the area and will not be able to eat this anytime i wanted...  little deep fried churros that simply put, are the most delicious churro ive ever had... crispy, fried, buttery, sweet, cinnamon-y, just simply amazing little things...  go to The Mission.
4288<>xx<>eat the churros.
4289<>xx<>you will geek out when you do....
4290<>xx<>One of the best places to go in Scottsdale.
4291<>xx<>Absolutely perfect.
4292<>xx<>Service, food, drinks... Everything.
4293<>xx<>Don't miss this one.
4294<>xx<>Price is probably on the upper end but not bad.
4295<>xx<>I recommend this place to everyone.
4296<>xx<>I love this place!
4297<>xx<>Love, love, love...
4298<>xx<>Great food and drinks!
4299<>xx<>I also love the atmosphere...not always the best service, but worth it for the food and surroundings.
4300<>xx<>beautiful restaurant, incredible food, NICE people who work there
4301<>xx<>WOW!!
4302<>xx<>The Mission is incredible.
4303<>xx<>One of the top 5 restaurants in all of Phoenix if you ask me.
4304<>xx<>They hit on all cylinders, the food is awesome (try the pork shoulder) the ambiance is beautiful and inviting, the staff is knowledgable and attractive and the bar has great cocktails.
4305<>xx<>Wine list could be a little more diverse but all in all one of the best places i've dined in Arizona.
4306<>xx<>If you haven't been here you must go.
4307<>xx<>Great place to have a nice dinner or take a date.
4308<>xx<>The ambiance is great, this is a beautiful restaurant.
4309<>xx<>However I felt underwhelmed by the food especially considering some of the rave reviews here.
4310<>xx<>We did try the pork belly pibil appetizer I had read about.
4311<>xx<>The pork was wonderfully tender but had little flavor other than the dollop of sauce on top.
4312<>xx<>The mahi mahi tacos were again OK but nothing to write home about.
4313<>xx<>The fried bananas dessert was a tasty standout.
4314<>xx<>Also it may sound silly but the espresso was excellent.
4315<>xx<>Overall going to The Mission was an enjoyable experience but I don't see much need to return.
4316<>xx<>Great people watching!
4317<>xx<>I mean it was a Friday night and not only did me and Dottsy Z score a great parking spot, but we also scored great seats at the bar.
4318<>xx<>The drinks we had were pretty strong, small but strong but the bartenders are NOT the friendliest of the bunch.
4319<>xx<>I get the fact that you are busy but  you can pretend to actually like the customers you are serving.
4320<>xx<>One of the bartenders got upset because a patron was saving a seat next to her for her friend who was trying to find a parking spot.
4321<>xx<>He said to her that since it was soooo busy she could not save the seat (since there was this massive line of people waiting for said seat-- said sarcastically of course) We were a little put off but whateve.
4322<>xx<>Or when the group that was celebrating a friends birthday and the birthday girl asked for suggestions as to what would be a good drink, he told her to read the menu to see the ingredients in the drinks and go from there.
4323<>xx<>Ouch!
4324<>xx<>However It didn't stop us from having a good time, it just made this review even more interesting.
4325<>xx<>All in all, great people watching, small,expensive but strong drinks, and not so friendly bartenders.
4326<>xx<>Heading out to the Dodge Theater for a Lyle Lovette concert last Thurs - 8/13 and decided we needed to try a new place!
4327<>xx<>We had walked by Hanny's before, but it looked a bit too trendy for our past outings ...this time though,  we were goin' in!!
4328<>xx<>Arrived and loved the ambiance - light music playing in the background.
4329<>xx<>The place was very hip and contemporary, but not 'unfriendly' ....had a good vibe to it.
4330<>xx<>Unfortunately for them, they weren't horribly busy.
4331<>xx<>We were greeted and seated promptly.
4332<>xx<>As we were commenting about the coolness of the place the music got a bit louder and then it turned WEIRD.... when the waitress stopped to take our drink order - i even asked 'is THAT music??'
4333<>xx<>to which she confirmed it was -  hummmm Don't worry - the music eventually turned into normal tunes suitable for dining and talking  : )   Drinks??
4334<>xx<>Oh my - they have quite a few interesting choices.
4335<>xx<>My date ordered the mojito - it was art in itself!
4336<>xx<>Beautiful and quite tasty!
4337<>xx<>I had a wonderful glass (or two)  of the Leese Fitch Cabernet wine --mmmmm, it was very good!!
4338<>xx<>For starts we ordered the Bar Plate appetizer.
4339<>xx<>The prosciutto was great, melon was perfectly ripe, cheese, nuts were very good.
4340<>xx<>The olives were ok -noting special.
4341<>xx<>BTW - My wine went splendidly with everything on the plate, and in case you are wondering, the bar plate was perfect for two to share.
4342<>xx<>I will confess, we are 'trying' to eat lighter these days ...(arghhhh) so instead of trying several different things as my stomach was hoping,  we opted to split a pizza.
4343<>xx<>We ordered the veggie pizza and added chicken!
4344<>xx<>yah -- i hear ya - it's really no longer a 'veggie' pizza is it??
4345<>xx<>Anyhoo ...the pizza was FANTASTIC!!
4346<>xx<>it was perfectly cooked - i loved the crust and the veggies ...ohhh and the chicken too!
4347<>xx<>(like i said - it was a great pizza!)
4348<>xx<>Oh and we polished off the whole pizza!!
4349<>xx<>Truly i really would have tried to steal a slice from my date, but he ate faster than i did!!
4350<>xx<>I think next time, i'll order more!
4351<>xx<>I did catch a glimpse of plates being served and the sandwiches look amazing as did the salads.
4352<>xx<>I'm looking forward to trying those too!!!
4353<>xx<>At the end of it all ..... i know i will definitely go there again.
4354<>xx<>I wouldn't say you need to be 'dressed up' for Hanny's but you certainly wouldn't want to show up in gym clothes.
4355<>xx<>Like i had mentioned earlier, it wasn't too busy so i hope the word continues to get out and they stay in business.
4356<>xx<>It is such a great place for downtown dinning!
4357<>xx<>!
4358<>xx<>This space has GREAT potential...
4359<>xx<>The question is...will it ever achieve it ??
4360<>xx<>I applaud the "vision" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008.
4361<>xx<>Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here.
4362<>xx<>The main "lobby" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation.
4363<>xx<>The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area.
4364<>xx<>Speaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing...
4365<>xx<>The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka.
4366<>xx<>I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the "birdbath" martini  size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups...
4367<>xx<>I'm thinking that these are not the standard size  and it was all just a very evil joke!
4368<>xx<>(Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side.
4369<>xx<>Once  the spear of olives is removed from the drink,  the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration?
4370<>xx<>fabrication?
4371<>xx<>Order one and decide for yourself)  Speaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait...
4372<>xx<>I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me.
4373<>xx<>Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet??
4374<>xx<>The restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof.
4375<>xx<>This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude.
4376<>xx<>The "deconstructed" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.
4377<>xx<>Well, that's not true.. as there IS something exciting in this bar...
4378<>xx<>The bathroom area on the mezzanine level!!..
4379<>xx<>mirrors and white hot lighting ensures that if you look "good" in that lighting... you'll look "GREAT" in the soft lighting of the bar area.
4380<>xx<>The balcony seating area in my opinion would be better used as a low seating area rather than a dining area.
4381<>xx<>One can only hope that the upper floors will be used for live music and outdoor seating.
4382<>xx<>The basement should be opening soon, potentially a moshpit dance area?
4383<>xx<>Who knows..
4384<>xx<>If you've been to Swigg in Santa Fe, you'll feel right at home here...
4385<>xx<>Check it out, give it a try... or wait until they "weed out" the bad help and get the place up to speed.
4386<>xx<>The St Germain martini is Awesome!!
4387<>xx<>I loved the cauliflower app.
4388<>xx<>My sandwich was just ok, but I would definitely go back and try something else.
4389<>xx<>Roast Beef Sandwich.
4390<>xx<>Nice textures and excellent bread and onion straws.
4391<>xx<>Could have used a bit more moisty type contrast like a mayonnaisie creation.
4392<>xx<>Hanny's is so much fun!
4393<>xx<>It's swanky and has its own DJ.
4394<>xx<>If you're looking for a fun place to go with friends for drinks, yummy food, and a cool ambiance, this is it!
4395<>xx<>Hipster Novelty.
4396<>xx<>My first thought walking into Hanny's was WOW this place is swanky.
4397<>xx<>After taking a seat and looking around I realized that most of the people there were hipsters with jeans and t-shirts.
4398<>xx<>I ordered the Rocket Salad and a dirty martini.
4399<>xx<>For the salad, I was expecting a large arugula salad decked out with olives, sopressata (whatever that is), and provolone.
4400<>xx<>I was deceived and instead got a small 1 1/2 cup serving of arugula with one hard boiled egg on the side and maybe four thin slices of sopressata and no cheese in sight.
4401<>xx<>It tasted like the arugula had lemon juice squeezed on top and honestly it looked like 50 calories.
4402<>xx<>I was so incredibly disappointed and a little drunk from the martini considering I had eaten such a small meal.
4403<>xx<>Anywho I went on my merry way and ended up snacking when I got home later.
4404<>xx<>I give this place 2 stars solely because the martini was good and they had a well stocked bar.
4405<>xx<>When I'm in downtown Phoenix, I frequently visit this spot and sit at the martini bar.
4406<>xx<>Everything from their classic cocktails to their outstanding food, the bartenders also cut and prepare fresh meat and cheese platters right in front of you.
4407<>xx<>On weekends, DJ up-top will spin classic hiphop music..just enough to set the vibe for good conversation and bumping your head but not loud enough where it's a club.
4408<>xx<>I am very excited I get to write about Hanny's!
4409<>xx<>We went to Hanny's before a concert at the US Airways arena.
4410<>xx<>The location could not have been better.
4411<>xx<>Upon entering the restaurant I was informed by my friend that this building used to house an old department store- very cool history and found out later VERY COOL RESTROOMS UPSTAIRS!!!!!!!!!
4412<>xx<>Who doesn't love a cool restroom?!
4413<>xx<>It was decorated beautifully with modern touches.
4414<>xx<>They have a ton of tasty cocktails to choose from.
4415<>xx<>I got some type of mojito or something which was out of this world.
4416<>xx<>Then let's pause and take a minute to get prepared to read about their amazing flatbread pizzas!
4417<>xx<>I ordered the Bianco (it was a tad spicy but other than that it was perfect).
4418<>xx<>This flat bread was huge and definitely shareable.
4419<>xx<>I had friends that got the Prosciutto Pizza and it was absolutely divine.
4420<>xx<>I plan on getting that the next time I go back.
4421<>xx<>Hanny's is a must if you live in or visiting Phoenix!
4422<>xx<>I can't wait to go back!
4423<>xx<>I really wanted to come here.
4424<>xx<>Finally, after months of trying to get my husband we came here last Saturday.
4425<>xx<>We got there about midnight but the place serves food till 1 which was awesome since we were at Castles and Coasters with friends and were totally starving.
4426<>xx<>The food, I had the chopped salad, was amazing.
4427<>xx<>It came all separate on the plate and I was really worried that there was no way I could get the salad all mixed up on the plate, but it worked out great and the salad was so so good!
4428<>xx<>My husband and our friends also had some pretty great meals.
4429<>xx<>The decor is just super cool, there is tons of mirrors in the hallways upstairs on your way to the bathroom.
4430<>xx<>It is a great place and I really wish it was busier!!!
4431<>xx<>We will be back because it was so well worth it.
4432<>xx<>We brought a group of seven to Daily Dose yesterday.
4433<>xx<>Living in Chicago, I am lucky to have dozens of great brunch places close by, so I'm spoiled a bit.
4434<>xx<>However, DD was certainly very good and in most places, this would be my go-to spot for breakfast chow.
4435<>xx<>As others seems to have mentioned, the breakfast nachos are ridiculous.
4436<>xx<>The chips are tasty but more importantly they are solid, sturdy bits that are required because the eggs, chorizo and cheese on top would have broken weaker chip siblings.
4437<>xx<>A number of us took a bite of the chorizo and had that "WTF!"
4438<>xx<>look on our faces because it was so good.
4439<>xx<>I ordered a turkey sausage omelet with fruit.
4440<>xx<>The toast wasn't great, but the omelet, home fries and fruit were pretty good (although the pineapple was a little out-of-the-can syrupy, if you are a Dole pineapple rings person!).
4441<>xx<>Prices were fair for the large portion size and the staff was fantastic, including a manager (or maybe the owner?)
4442<>xx<>who spent some time sharing laughs at our table.
4443<>xx<>DD certainly draws a crowd in a tight window around the 10-11:30 AM block, when folks are looking for chow before heading out to day games.
4444<>xx<>But otherwise it seems like it's easy to slide in for brunch.
4445<>xx<>Kobe hamburger with pretzel bread.
4446<>xx<>That's all you need to know!
4447<>xx<>Yeah, I'm a fan!
4448<>xx<>I visited Daily Dose on Whiskey Wednesday.
4449<>xx<>That means $5 whiskeys.
4450<>xx<>After one of those, I just had to eat something!
4451<>xx<>Well, hello Kobe burger!
4452<>xx<>I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun!
4453<>xx<>Whew!
4454<>xx<>The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke.
4455<>xx<>The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me).
4456<>xx<>The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel.
4457<>xx<>I was a happy girl!
4458<>xx<>I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch!
4459<>xx<>I hope they can wow me like they did before!
4460<>xx<>I stayed in AZ for two weeks, and I ate here about 4x.
4461<>xx<>Located right between Starbucks and Bank of America.
4462<>xx<>The burgers are awesome.
4463<>xx<>The salads are amazing.
4464<>xx<>The Cobb Salad is huge and extremely tasty.
4465<>xx<>All items were very affordable.
4466<>xx<>Happy Hour is between 4-8PM (I believe) and all burgers are $2 off.
4467<>xx<>So that is a great time to stop by.
4468<>xx<>Service at Daily Dose was exemplary - my soda never reached half empty (or half full =]).
4469<>xx<>Great spot for any time of the day.
4470<>xx<>Protein pancakes are so delicious!!
4471<>xx<>Lots of berries cooked in them.
4472<>xx<>Yum yum.
4473<>xx<>One of my favorites.
4474<>xx<>Nice, small patio with good service but food was mediocre.
4475<>xx<>Nachos were not warmed all the way through.
4476<>xx<>Chicken skewers were passable.
4477<>xx<>Bacon on burger was thick but not crispy, and I found the pretzel bun too dense to enjoy.
4478<>xx<>Best food item at our table was the panko calamari.
4479<>xx<>The portion seems generous until you eat a few and realize it's sitting on a bed of greens for some extra height.
4480<>xx<>Happy hour goes 'til 8 but their prices are not the best so I don't know if it's worth it.
4481<>xx<>What a great breakfast spot!
4482<>xx<>Came here for a quick one yesterday before heading over to work for our complimentary annual flu shot and work after.
4483<>xx<>The weather was delightful enough that I toyed with the idea of dining outside, but wasn't sure if smoking was allowed (I don't smoke).
4484<>xx<>I decided to dine in at the counter, but did find out that smoking isn't allowed in all dining areas, at least not in Scottsdale!
4485<>xx<>I'll have to try patio-dining with friends soon.
4486<>xx<>Had ordered the biscuits and gravy platter, which came with herbed potatoes and fruit, but all I really wanted was a biscuit and gravy, and soon spotted it among the sides menu and cancelled the original.
4487<>xx<>My only complaint during yesterday's experience was that I felt my server had pressured me into ordering more than I had wanted to.
4488<>xx<>I'd asked if their gravy was chunky since most of the places that boast "sausage gravy" LIE, and she assured me that I'd love their chunky gravy, so I knew not to order a side of sausage patties, but she had asked me more than three times if I wanted to order two sides, so I thought of trying the bacon, but decided against it when my inquiry of whether or not it contained corn syrup and celery juice came back positive.
4489<>xx<>So I went with the patties.
4490<>xx<>There wasn't a need to order more meat as the side of B&G is ample enough for little young me :)  [This dish kept me going for almost six hours!]
4491<>xx<>I loved this spicy breakfast item so much, I came back for more this morning!
4492<>xx<>I literally bumped into an old friend, at the Mayo Clinic of all places!, and we thought it'd be nice catch up during breakfast afterwards.
4493<>xx<>I arrived earlier and placed my order in for a biscuit and gravy ($3.95) and one stuffed pancake ($2.95).
4494<>xx<>I chose the peach creme brulee.
4495<>xx<>(This was going to be a treat as I haven't had peaches in three years!)
4496<>xx<>No powdered sugar, please, and FYI, the pancake syrup here isn't 100% maple.
4497<>xx<>My friend, who exercises and counts calories as much as I do, was going to look at the pancake list when I, recalling he liked egg-white omelets, told him that DD offered an egg-white wrap.
4498<>xx<>He instantly ordered this, but also ordered a blueberry and banana pancake made w/ honey whole wheat.
4499<>xx<>(I'd lamented that the server hadn't asked me for my batter preference, so my pal said he'd order one with whole wheat, for me to try.
4500<>xx<>A pleasant double-surprise was when he chose blueberries and banana, the latter which I haven't eaten in three years!)
4501<>xx<>He absolutely loved his egg-white wrap.
4502<>xx<>I almost tried a bite, but didn't want to play with fire since I was already trying my luck with the peaches and the banana.
4503<>xx<>(The wrap contained eggs and mushrooms...)  I loved both of the pancakes- the peach creme brulee was perfect w/out any added butter or syrup, but my friend's pancake needed a little maple syrup.
4504<>xx<>Thank goodness I always carry some, just in case!
4505<>xx<>=)  Can't wait for that upcoming UYE a yelper teased about during our jaunt at Haus Murphy's ;)
4506<>xx<>Favorite breakfast place in Old Town.
4507<>xx<>Every dish I have gotten is great.
4508<>xx<>Large portions so come hungry.
4509<>xx<>Get the protein pancakes!!
4510<>xx<>!
4511<>xx<>I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and everything I've had was amazing.
4512<>xx<>I have at least had bites of their chorizo nachos, their salmon omelette with a side of squash bites, their peach pancakes, their chicken alfredo pasta, their veggie burger on an amazing pretzel bun, and their regular cheeseburger.
4513<>xx<>all were delish!
4514<>xx<>my favorite drink is their swirl -- the margarita with frozen sangria
4515<>xx<>I went here last Sunday for brunch with a girlfriend.
4516<>xx<>The waitress was a little show to serve us, but it was packed and they did not chase us out when we lingered.
4517<>xx<>The soy latte was delicious!
4518<>xx<>The veggie omelette was also excellent... of course, it's the "DD Hash" I've completely fallen in love with.
4519<>xx<>I will be back!
4520<>xx<>Went for breakfast shared the side biscuits and gravy and the crab cake benedict with my mom.
4521<>xx<>It was good, if I went again I'd just get the ham benedict the crab cake wasn't as good as I was hoping.
4522<>xx<>Biscuits and gravy was average.
4523<>xx<>My mom got the Bloody Mary and thought it was okay, nothing special.
4524<>xx<>We sat on the patio it was nice although the traffic was a little loud which we got used to.
4525<>xx<>I would give the toast I started my meal with 5 stars though!
4526<>xx<>Whipped butter with blueberry jelly was amazing!
4527<>xx<>!
4528<>xx<>More impressed than I thought I would be.
4529<>xx<>The food and salads are great, nothing fancy.
4530<>xx<>I also did the buffet for breakfast one morning, and it was good.
4531<>xx<>No complaints about this place overall.
4532<>xx<>The review is retro as I was reminded recently just how bitter I was about Grand Lux.
4533<>xx<>We went there TWICE in our weekend trip and, for the life of me, I cannot fathom why.
4534<>xx<>Vegas is the land of seafood buffets and supposedly *good* buffets in general.
4535<>xx<>Yet, somehow, we ended up in Grand Lux.
4536<>xx<>TWICE.
4537<>xx<>So bitter.
4538<>xx<>The food was ... well, it was Grand Lux.
4539<>xx<>It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't anything that you would remember or even think about a day later.
4540<>xx<>Also, since the portions are unnecessarily huge (and, I assure you, you are paying for every ounce of it), we had leftovers so we jokingly asked the waiter if we could put it in the Grand Lux fridge.
4541<>xx<>He said sure and that we could come back and get it later.
4542<>xx<>Total fake-out.
4543<>xx<>We came back the next day and asked a different waiter for our food.
4544<>xx<>He looked confused and told us that wasn't allowed at all (health violation?).
4545<>xx<>So, I ask, First Waiter, why would you trick a bunch of tourists with promises of potential leftovers?
4546<>xx<>That's just wrong.
4547<>xx<>And mean.
4548<>xx<>And I don't like Grand Lux.
4549<>xx<>Go eat at a buffet.
4550<>xx<>I heard the one at Rio was good, but I wouldn't know, because I was eating at Grand Lux *sob*
4551<>xx<>Pros: food is great, price is fair, and atmosphere is the best  Cons: long wait, busy but slow service  Another thought, there is another one right by the Venetian, will try that one
4552<>xx<>omg.
4553<>xx<>so me and my husband came here for our 2yr anniversary at the venetian and ate.
4554<>xx<>I must say we were slightly disappointed, dont get me wrong the food and drinks were great but the environment was so noisey and the seating was awful and uncomfortable.
4555<>xx<>if you're looking for romance dont eat here, but it is pretty good and gorgeous.
4556<>xx<>You cannot go wrong at this place!
4557<>xx<>Had an amazing burger that featured beef, short ribs, bacon and cheddar.
4558<>xx<>On vacation, calories dont count!
4559<>xx<>My buddies tried some of the other burgers on the menu and everyone loved their choices.
4560<>xx<>Great food, fun place, pretty reasonable prices.
4561<>xx<>Came here for a quick casual lunch before leaving for the airport to go home.
4562<>xx<>We were going to come here for lunch the day prior but our group was too big and the wait was forever.
4563<>xx<>But on this day, there was only 3 survivors so we got a table right away.
4564<>xx<>This place is owned by the same owners of Cheesecake Factory.
4565<>xx<>That gives you the general description, price, atmosphere, of the place.
4566<>xx<>We got there in time for breakfast foods which they serve til 11am.
4567<>xx<>I shared the Belgian waffles with strawberry with a side of scrambled eggs.
4568<>xx<>My friend got the chillaquilles which were AMAZING.
4569<>xx<>I've never had them before, and I'm not sure how they taste like anywhere else.
4570<>xx<>But they were really good at this place!
4571<>xx<>It's like tortilla chips topped with eggs, salsa, avocado, cheese, beans, etc.
4572<>xx<>It was really good.
4573<>xx<>The server we had was great.
4574<>xx<>Very friendly, talkative, and quick.
4575<>xx<>However, I have one tip for the hostess stand.
4576<>xx<>Apparently, the lead host takes your name and how many people in your party and finds a table on the POS system and probably because it's such a big restaurant and there are many hostesses who seat guests and the lead host doesn't have the time to stand there and wait for an actual host to come up and verbally tell them where to seat the guests, they print out a receipt thing that tells the hostess where to seat the guests.
4577<>xx<>This is fine but every time she printed it out, she put it on the counter that stands between the guests and herself.
4578<>xx<>So many of the guests, reach for the ticket.
4579<>xx<>And she has to tell each one "no this is not for you" / "this is for the hostess" etc and she looked irritated each time she said it.
4580<>xx<>So maybe putting it somewhere where the guests don't reach for it would make sense..
4581<>xx<>I'm an average guy.
4582<>xx<>I don't traipse about night clubs making it "rain" in "da club."
4583<>xx<>I don't "pop bottles" all that often, unless it involves some Pepsi.
4584<>xx<>I don't valet my "whip."
4585<>xx<>So to me, Venetian/Palazzo is a little too shi-shi for my tastes.
4586<>xx<>However, when the BGB and I wanted to hit up some food after his shift at work, he recommended the Cheesecake Factory.
4587<>xx<>"It's open 24 hours," he said.
4588<>xx<>Well, he really meant this place, which mildly worried me, since now I was inside the V/P at one of their restaurants, and my wallet was still on a Luxor budget.
4589<>xx<>Fortunately, the food was really good.
4590<>xx<>Turns out Grand Lux Cafe is managed (?)
4591<>xx<>by the same people as Cheesecake Factory, which always puts out a good product.
4592<>xx<>Bread is nice and tasty to start.
4593<>xx<>We both had burgers (because you know I love burgers) and the meat was tender and flavorful.
4594<>xx<>The atmosphere was nice -- you didn't feel like you were in what amounts to a casino cafe.
4595<>xx<>Maybe one time when I have a little more money to spare I'll try a more signature dish, but for a first start it was rather good.
4596<>xx<>how can you not love this place?
4597<>xx<>its awesome that its 24 hrs.
4598<>xx<>definitely the perfect spot for some late night grub after drinking and getting your groove on at the club.
4599<>xx<>my friends and i actually stopped here for lunch.
4600<>xx<>the food is very much like cheesecake factory.
4601<>xx<>they have a huge menu!
4602<>xx<>once you think you've decided on something theres another page with so many other choices.
4603<>xx<>i ordered the cobb salad which was pretty hearty.
4604<>xx<>my friends shared the margarita pizza and blt sandwich...both of which were very good as well.
4605<>xx<>our waitress was great, super nice and attentive.
4606<>xx<>don't forget to order some of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies!
4607<>xx<>so good....
4608<>xx<>Order list salad soup margherita pizza shaking beef mongolian steak bbq salmon choc chip cookies  Party of 4  everyone was very satisfied with their order, plating was very presentable and unique,  the other couple was very acclimated with the restaurant so the repeat order of shaking chicken and mongolian steak was spot on.
4609<>xx<>the margherita pizza wasnt the best though.
4610<>xx<>the supposed made from scratch cookies were delish ^_^  the only part i really felt i missed out on was the service.
4611<>xx<>nothing terribly wrong like a spill or incorrect order, just an entree that wasnt noted and therefore delivered late since it had to be inquired about and THEN ordered.
4612<>xx<>while the 3 of us had food eating the other mrs had an empty placement!
4613<>xx<>we also had to ask for the cookies to be brought out earlier because we didnt want to stay that late... but we still ended up waiting for them after we had finished eating and gotten the leftovers boxed.
4614<>xx<>still then we asked twice for the check and waited.
4615<>xx<>it wasnt busy, there was no wait to get in, so i have no clue what the deal was, maybe short staffed or just absent minded ~_~ final impression, it was a more spacious / prettier version of cheesecake factory but decorations dont really help the meal along  im tired now ill upload a pic or 2 then gnite!
4616<>xx<>Almost crusted fish with mashed potatoes was excellent.
4617<>xx<>Rib eye ok.
4618<>xx<>Reasonable prices and huge portions
4619<>xx<>I really enjoyed our dinner here.
4620<>xx<>We came to Vegas this past weekend for my sister's bachelorette party and she decided to choose this restaurant for one of our dinners'.
4621<>xx<>We had a set menu, which was called the Chef's Menu.
4622<>xx<>Everything we ordered on there was so delicious.
4623<>xx<>I had the Tomato Bisque soup, Grilled Artichoke, Jidori Chicken and for dessert I had the donuts.
4624<>xx<>I enjoyed every bit of it except for the dessert.
4625<>xx<>The donut was kind of dry and the sauce wasn't anything special.
4626<>xx<>Everything else was good and the atmosphere was great.
4627<>xx<>The staff wasn't as friendly as I thought they would be, so that was a little disappointing.
4628<>xx<>We come to Vegas to spend and for them to not be super friendly is sad.
4629<>xx<>I would have given them a 4 star if the staff was a lot nicer because the food was exceptional.
4630<>xx<>This place is the cutest place to have sunday brunch.
4631<>xx<>Those cotton candy pink sofas are the cure to anyone's 3 night bender!
4632<>xx<>And their food is delish.
4633<>xx<>I had the crab sandwich and it hit the spot!!
4634<>xx<>The mac n cheese still is making my mouth water!
4635<>xx<>It can get crowded and the lines can be lengthy.
4636<>xx<>But it is worth the wait!
4637<>xx<>Cute decor, attentive staff, and yummy food!!
4638<>xx<>Best brunch in LV in my opinion!
4639<>xx<>Great lunch specials, although the service was slow.
4640<>xx<>I enjoyed a tomato soup and a salad and both were delicious, but the food took forever to come out (but then again so did out waters...)
4641<>xx<>Expensive but what do you expect from a place at the Wynn.
4642<>xx<>I can't remember what I ordered, but what I do remember were the amazing pretzel sticks!
4643<>xx<>They were so soft and warm!!!
4644<>xx<>I would go here just for those!
4645<>xx<>and thats it.
4646<>xx<>lol
4647<>xx<>Stopped for the Happy Hour specials.
4648<>xx<>The food was only OK- greasy appetizers barely better than bar food.
4649<>xx<>Drinks were weak and watery and an issue over the buy one get one was only handled after a discussion with the manager.
4650<>xx<>I don't really have much to say about this place.
4651<>xx<>It is a good upper level cafe, with a more expensive menu.
4652<>xx<>Would I eat here again?
4653<>xx<>If I was staying at the Encore and needed a bite to eat that wasn't fast food, i'd definitely eat here!!!!
4654<>xx<>!
4655<>xx<>We arrived in Vegas famished, and after passing by the mob at the check-in desk for the Encore, we strolled in to the Society Café for lunch.
4656<>xx<>Service was very good, and it's a nice open setting.
4657<>xx<>However, for the price you can do much better elsewhere.
4658<>xx<>On the advice of our server, I opted for the lobster roll with fries, while the wife got the Caesar salad with chicken.
4659<>xx<>Maybe I have spent too much time in Boston, but the lobster roll was underwhelming.
4660<>xx<>I was starving, so I polished off my plate (and some of my wife's).
4661<>xx<>But if we hadn't been in danger of passing out, we would have probably walked across the street to one of the many options at the Fashion Show mall.
4662<>xx<>I have not been so excited for a meal since I ate at Alex.
4663<>xx<>Wynn really, really has it going on for us vegans.
4664<>xx<>I heard through the grapevine that multiple outlets in the Wynn now serve s fast food-esque meal - cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake made with coconut milk ice cream.
4665<>xx<>And it's $9.
4666<>xx<>Upon hearing this, my husband and I practically ran out of the door.
4667<>xx<>With a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this meal out at Society Cafe.
4668<>xx<>It has an open atmosphere to which you can people-watch which is fun.
4669<>xx<>The seating and design of the cafe is impeccable - gigantic, bright pink sofas, black & white, and soft lime green is a very soothing yet hip palette to me.
4670<>xx<>When we walked up to the hostess, she immediately asked us if we wanted a vegan menu.
4671<>xx<>Very nice that I didn't have to ask!
4672<>xx<>We were seated and greeted by our server Michel, who upon hearing our order exclaimed with genuine delight that we were really going to enjoy our meal.
4673<>xx<>This made me even more excited!
4674<>xx<>He also automatically told us he would bring out vegan bread and butter.
4675<>xx<>Upon doing so he remembered a second kind of bread, some pretzel sticks, were also vegan which he brought out too!
4676<>xx<>Great customer service for sure.
4677<>xx<>The fast food meal was adorable.
4678<>xx<>The cheeseburger (which looked like a 100% doppelgänger for a certain famous golden-arched restaurant's burger) was wrapped up in foil; the fries were in a cardboard sleeve.
4679<>xx<>The two hot items were in a cardboard half-box, all served on top of a white rectangular plate.
4680<>xx<>And the chocolate shake was in a Wynn plastic cup with a really thick straw which was great for drinking.
4681<>xx<>The burger I adored, although I passed off the pickles to the husband.
4682<>xx<>I think the Gardein patty might have been slightly overcooked, or it might need some light seasoning... it wasn't as juicy as it could have been, and was a little bland, but overall I liked it; I really want to know what kind of "cheese" they used!
4683<>xx<>The fries were delicious, and the milkshake was TO DIE FOR.
4684<>xx<>I could seriously have that every single day.
4685<>xx<>IN LOVE!
4686<>xx<>The meal was beyond delightful, and the customer service was wonderful to boot.
4687<>xx<>Michel really made the experience pleasurable, and answered every question quite knowledgeably.
4688<>xx<>Even when he wasn't sure, he asked and got back to us in a very timely manner.
4689<>xx<>We asked him about a dessert area in another part of the hotel to which he got the hostess (her name escapes me, but she was brilliant) who divulged that she was a vegetarian and tried her best to get us some answers, and spent some time chatting with us.
4690<>xx<>She was very nice and extremely helpful and both her and Michel went above and beyond to make our meal lovely.
4691<>xx<>I think this might start to be a weekly thing for me.
4692<>xx<>Not only is this meal affordable, but the Wynn has really turned into a haven for vegans.
4693<>xx<>Not once did I get an eye-roll, or was made to feel like I was annoying or asking too much.
4694<>xx<>I felt really accepted at this restaurant, and I love that even the staff enjoys the food and can really talk to it with their customers.
4695<>xx<>Society Cafe really pulled out all of the stops even for our humble meal, and I can't wait to come back for more!
4696<>xx<>We went for last night for their $39 prix fixe Thanksgiving dinner.
4697<>xx<>Made a reservation for 7pm, but we were early so had to wait a bit.
4698<>xx<>The prix fixe dinner was a Kabocha Squash Soup and Slow-Roasted Free Range Turkey with pancetta and sage stuffing, mashed potato, root vegetables and cranberry compote.
4699<>xx<>The included dessert would have been a pumpkin tart, but they ran out.
4700<>xx<>Instead they offered donut bites, which felt oddly unequal to the promised pumpkin tart, so we skipped it.
4701<>xx<>The soup was very creamy and delicious.
4702<>xx<>To go along with the soup we were given some pretzel bites and some kind of mustard butter that tasted fantastic.
4703<>xx<>The turkey tasted good, but there wasn't enough gravy.
4704<>xx<>To my disappointment the restaurant sits right next to the casino floor.
4705<>xx<>The pictures on their site make the atmosphere look much more secluded and interesting.
4706<>xx<>Unfortunately you can still hear all of the slot machines beeping and dinging away, so it isn't the most pleasant dining experience.
4707<>xx<>So the food was good, but overall the experience wasn't that great.
4708<>xx<>If you want dinner for a special occasion, go elsewhere.
4709<>xx<>We enjoyed both a breakfast and lunch here while staying at the Encore.
4710<>xx<>After checking in to the hotel we stopped by here for a quick bite.
4711<>xx<>As soon as we walked up to the hostess, and I saw they had a bowl of red Swedish fish out (with a serving spoon of course) I knew this place was going to be awesome, because I loooooooooooove red Swedish fish!
4712<>xx<>They also serve these awesome pretzel sticks (one is pumpernickel) with peanut butter butter....these were spectacular To be honest with you I would have been fine with just the red fish and pretzel sticks...I'm low maintenance like that ; )   Okay, anyways...I ended up ordering the chopped salad and hubby had the ham and cheese sandwich.
4713<>xx<>We also enjoyed the chicken lollipop chicken wings for an appetizer.
4714<>xx<>All were great choices and definitely hit the spot.
4715<>xx<>We also visited this place for breakfast on our last day here, and I had the egg white frittata and he had the mini quiches.
4716<>xx<>I did order a side of nine grain toast with mine and was only able to finish about half of my frittata...it was huge too!
4717<>xx<>I loved the goat cheese in my frittata, but found myself digging into the middle just to get to the goat cheese!
4718<>xx<>His mini quiches were just that....mini, and served with a side of tuna salad I think.
4719<>xx<>Breakfast was also served with some nice entertainment...some old guy with sunglasses wondered in and just passed out on one of the couch/benches right beside another diner.
4720<>xx<>Everyone started looking around like "something just doesn't seem right with this" (and giggling of course).
4721<>xx<>He started kicking the diners that were next to him (I guess to get more comfortable) and they were moved to another nearby table before security escorted the drunk guy out.
4722<>xx<>It was just funny how the whole thing came about...you just don't see that everyday, even in Vegas, and definitely not the Encore, haha!
4723<>xx<>Loved Society Cafe and plan to return (mainly for the Swedish fish and pretzel sticks)!!
4724<>xx<>!
4725<>xx<>Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this Gem that wasn't  attached   to a Hotel or Mall.
4726<>xx<>we were greeted by a friendly host.
4727<>xx<>The rest of the staff are very efficient & friendly.
4728<>xx<>Very Good down home Breakfast...good fluffy French toast with a touch of cinnamon.
4729<>xx<>Hubby ate the well reviewed  Cali  Omelette...I just needed stronger coffee but the good food and great staff was definitley 5 star worthy!
4730<>xx<>Mr. Mama's is hidden away inside a mini mall of shops off S. Decatur.
4731<>xx<>They serve good food at decent prices, but I wasn't blown away like most other patrons.
4732<>xx<>I went with the Chili & Cheese Omelet ($7): Cheddar Jack Cheese, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Green and Red Onions, and Mama's Chili.
4733<>xx<>The chili was a bit sweet and watery in consistency...I'd order something else next time around.
4734<>xx<>I also noticed the eggs weren't as "fluffy" as I am used to, comparing it to other omelet specific spots in town.
4735<>xx<>Since their chili is relatively popular, I either missed it on a good day, or my taste buds prefer thicker-hearty chilis with a hint of spice.
4736<>xx<>This was a bit sweet, boring and not for me.
4737<>xx<>I'm sure I will be back at some point...I'll try some of their other goodies next time.
4738<>xx<>A few pics of the goodies my group ordered :
4739<>xx<>Cheap good eats!
4740<>xx<>Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and Mr.Mama's does it right!
4741<>xx<>I've only eaten there a few times so far but I must say, it's amazing!
4742<>xx<>I'm writing this right after I just had the best omelet of my life.
4743<>xx<>I had their Cali omelet this morning and WHOA.
4744<>xx<>Didn't even use any ketchup or hot sauce on it.
4745<>xx<>You can tell the ingredients were super fresh.
4746<>xx<>I was watching the guys in the kitchen work and they were very detailed with their cooking!
4747<>xx<>I have yet to try their lunch, but soon will.
4748<>xx<>The owner Nick is super friendly every time I've came in for a pickup and treats you like family.
4749<>xx<>I've been to every breakfast spot in a 5 mile radius from here and this place tops them all!
4750<>xx<>Do yourself a favor and give them a visit!
4751<>xx<>Best place in the area!!!
4752<>xx<>My daughter and I love to go there.
4753<>xx<>We go since they opened.
4754<>xx<>Love their breatkfast!
4755<>xx<>It's so fresh and delicioius.
4756<>xx<>Great customer service and reasonable prices!
4757<>xx<>!
4758<>xx<>Folks screw coming to Vegas for the slots, strippers and shows....   Come for Mr. Mamma's..... At least that's the only reason I will ever be coming back to Vegas!
4759<>xx<>Good ass home cooked food, good price, big portions, THE BEST customer service in THE WORLD....
4760<>xx<>It's dinner truck-stop food, bottomless coffee always filled, and refilled by the coolest nicest burley tattooed dude ever, heck I was in good company!
4761<>xx<>A zero tolerance for hungover douchebags, seriously you don't want to mess with the staff here.... Just eat your perfect chicken-fried steak, eggs and hash browns, be nice, drink your coffee and nurse that hangover!
4762<>xx<>I have to rate this place highest on my list of best places to eat with best customer service!
4763<>xx<>The omelettes was ok.
4764<>xx<>But the chicken friend steak was not good.
4765<>xx<>I could not taste the chicken, the gravy was salty.
4766<>xx<>The service was quick and friendly.
4767<>xx<>Superb!
4768<>xx<>Staff is extremely friendly and the breakfast is delicious.
4769<>xx<>My wife and I are very particular on our breakfast sandwiches and the waitress took our orders with a smile and brought exactly what we asked for.
4770<>xx<>Thank you!
4771<>xx<>My boyfriend and I discovered this place not to long ago being that it is close to his work, and we LOVE it.
4772<>xx<>I would highly suggest trying their gyros it is one of the best ive had in town, and keeps me coming back.
4773<>xx<>The staff is very friendly, the owner comes around often to check on the service and quality of the food.
4774<>xx<>The place it self is not overall fancy as far as painting and seating goes but it is comfortable and very clean.
4775<>xx<>No Complints Here :)
4776<>xx<>Amazing breakfast!
4777<>xx<>Great prices, excellent service, and a perfect way to take a break from the overpriced, touristy strip fare.
4778<>xx<>Food: AMAZING.
4779<>xx<>One of the best breakfast places I ate ever.
4780<>xx<>I ordered the Denver omelet which included hash browns and upgraded my toast to french toast for a $1.
4781<>xx<>Everything hit the spot!
4782<>xx<>Ambience: cute.
4783<>xx<>It was very blue.
4784<>xx<>Wait: Nope.
4785<>xx<>Service: They paid a lot of attention!
4786<>xx<>All the customers were locals except for us!
4787<>xx<>LOL   Will I come back:  Hell yeah!
4788<>xx<>Every time I go back to vegas!
4789<>xx<>A friend told me he was taking me somewhere "interesting."
4790<>xx<>Understatement of the year.
4791<>xx<>The atmosphere was rich, the food was great, the service was friendly and the music was phenomenal.
4792<>xx<>I don't know how they choose their tunes but it was the perfect soundtrack to a unexpectedly pleasant evening.
4793<>xx<>I don't like to use the word "hip," but there's almost no better word to describe the experience.
4794<>xx<>This is a great place to take friends and/or family.
4795<>xx<>Since the pasty's are cut in half, my friend and I decided to order something different and then split.
4796<>xx<>Seeing as it is November and Thanksgiving is just around the corner, we went with 'The Pilgrim' (roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing), and to see how they handle mainstream, we also got the 'Royale With Cheese' - yes, that is an amazing name.
4797<>xx<>It's essentially 'their cheeseburger.'
4798<>xx<>I had half of each, two glasses of Kronenbourg 1664, and I must say it was one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant in some time.
4799<>xx<>The service was incredible - friendly, personal, and quick - and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to everyone I know, as tempting as it is to keep such a wonderful location as "our little secret."
4800<>xx<>First off, I LOVE THE FOOD.
4801<>xx<>So giving this place three stars breaks my heart.
4802<>xx<>I've been to this and the Tempe location each a few times.
4803<>xx<>I do prefer this location because it feels more spacious.
4804<>xx<>I dropped in for lunch between meetings and sat at the bar facing the open kitchen.
4805<>xx<>And then I waited.
4806<>xx<>Somewhere around 12-15 minutes passed.
4807<>xx<>I almost got up and walked out, but the guy in the kitchen manning the oven noticed I was still sitting without a beverage and asked whether I'd been helped yet.
4808<>xx<>He offered to get me something to drink and took my food order.
4809<>xx<>The restaurant was not too busy, and there were a few servers wandering around.
4810<>xx<>Around the time my food was ready, one of the servers sat at the far side of the bar to eat lunch.
4811<>xx<>I finished my pasty and had to go to the cash register to pay.
4812<>xx<>I probably shouldn't have tipped, but I used to be a server, thus feel massive guilt for not doing so.
4813<>xx<>Moral of the story, I'll probably just order to go next time and eat in my car.
4814<>xx<>I hate when good restaurants are held back by poor service.
4815<>xx<>If you want a filling and creative meal- this is it!
4816<>xx<>How can you get better than a pie crust wrapped around anything from salmon and asparagus , greek feta chicken -to a thanksgiving meal - and wash it down with a cold beer- this place is a must taste- and you're hooked!
4817<>xx<>The only draw back was squeezing my very pregnant friend into a church pew booth- when pull out seats were limited- but - we left happily full with leftovers for later.
4818<>xx<>GO!
4819<>xx<>!
4820<>xx<>When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends.
4821<>xx<>Besides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub.
4822<>xx<>The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding.
4823<>xx<>One of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB).
4824<>xx<>It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth.
4825<>xx<>Granted the beer back then was warmer.
4826<>xx<>LOL  As we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here.
4827<>xx<>We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals.
4828<>xx<>Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken.
4829<>xx<>There was a lot of laughing.
4830<>xx<>Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company.
4831<>xx<>What a great atmosphere!
4832<>xx<>We started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling.
4833<>xx<>Both hit the spot nicely.
4834<>xx<>For dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50).
4835<>xx<>I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!
4836<>xx<>Both, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.
4837<>xx<>In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette.
4838<>xx<>But not here.
4839<>xx<>Surprising they were only $9.00 each.
4840<>xx<>Incredible.
4841<>xx<>For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00).
4842<>xx<>Both were also delicious.
4843<>xx<>Each of the above items were very filling.
4844<>xx<>We couldn't finish them, or the desserts.
4845<>xx<>So we had four "to go" boxes for later.
4846<>xx<>I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.
4847<>xx<>Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities.
4848<>xx<>We'll be back.
4849<>xx<>Enjoy!
4850<>xx<>Superb.
4851<>xx<>I have not met a pasty I didn't like here.
4852<>xx<>Oggie, veggie oggie, lamb vindaloo, carne adovada, etc., and the list goes on, and will continue to grow as I eat my way through the menu.
4853<>xx<>This is a great place for vegetarians as well since they use Quorn and faux ground beef.
4854<>xx<>My veggie oggie was almost indistinguishable in taste from a regular oggie.
4855<>xx<>Dessert is also excellent.
4856<>xx<>I've had the apple caramel pasty and it was the perfect way to end our meal.
4857<>xx<>This is a must-eat-at restaurant.
4858<>xx<>Plus, with enough happy hour car bombs ($2 after 10 PM, and from 3-5 PM), you can giggle inwardly (or outwardly) at the thought of eating something called "pasty" (yes, even though it really is pronounced Pass-teee).
4859<>xx<>Oh my Gaaawwwd.
4860<>xx<>Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner!
4861<>xx<>This is a Mesa (or Tempe) "Must-Try"!
4862<>xx<>My Dude and I have been here twice now.
4863<>xx<>Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here.
4864<>xx<>There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing.
4865<>xx<>We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.
4866<>xx<>It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles.
4867<>xx<>Another great touch to the great ambiance.
4868<>xx<>The first time we went, we got a table up front.
4869<>xx<>Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients.
4870<>xx<>Also, be prepared to wait a while.
4871<>xx<>Good food takes time!
4872<>xx<>Just grab a beer and enjoy your company.
4873<>xx<>Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties.
4874<>xx<>Both were absolutely delicious!
4875<>xx<>Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets.
4876<>xx<>Which my Mexican thought was hilarious.
4877<>xx<>Damn you, Dude.
4878<>xx<>Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes.
4879<>xx<>We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic.
4880<>xx<>Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked.
4881<>xx<>Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.
4882<>xx<>The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)!
4883<>xx<>Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made.
4884<>xx<>We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time.
4885<>xx<>Again, both great.
4886<>xx<>Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check.
4887<>xx<>Downside to the Bar?
4888<>xx<>You can come across groups of people telling you to "move over" so they can fit their group together.
4889<>xx<>Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.
4890<>xx<>There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order.
4891<>xx<>Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!
4892<>xx<>What a cool and odd place!!
4893<>xx<>The service was wonderful, the people - staff and customers were  fun and friendly!!
4894<>xx<>I went original - with the Oggie and loved it!!
4895<>xx<>Their red wine sauce - YUM!
4896<>xx<>I wanted a few more sides of it, but controlled myself!
4897<>xx<>Although when I asked for a take-home box, the waitress asked if i'd like more sauce!!!!
4898<>xx<>whooo hooo - heck YES i want more sauce!!
4899<>xx<>My date had the Mexican -- pasty.
4900<>xx<>It was nice and spicy!!
4901<>xx<>Interesting to have a mexican flavored irish pocket / sandwich - but hey, it works!!
4902<>xx<>Go give 'em a try -- it's a different type of place and all in a great way!
4903<>xx<>This place is amazing.
4904<>xx<>Love the atmosphere.
4905<>xx<>Drink selection is good.
4906<>xx<>The decor is ol church pews with doors for tables.
4907<>xx<>Great date place.
4908<>xx<>The food truly stands out.
4909<>xx<>Im a purist so i love the simple Bangers N Mash.
4910<>xx<>Eat here you will not regret it.
4911<>xx<>The long awaited second location finally open, Cornwall native Dean Thomas has another major hit on his hands!
4912<>xx<>A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say "Pass-Tee"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.
4913<>xx<>Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering.
4914<>xx<>From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu.
4915<>xx<>(Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.)
4916<>xx<>It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!
4917<>xx<>If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you.
4918<>xx<>Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch!
4919<>xx<>Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guinness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.
4920<>xx<>With more room to seat folks, a nice bar/counter, outdoor seating (complete with an area for those that still smoke.)
4921<>xx<>and TWO bathrooms the new Mesa location of the Cornish Pasty Co. is sure to be a huge success.
4922<>xx<>Take the time to stop by either location of The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again
4923<>xx<>Two words: I'm addicted.
4924<>xx<>I've been to Cornish pasty about 4 or 5 times now since I've discovered it and to this location about half of those times.
4925<>xx<>Every time I come here I am delighted by the aromas and the menu options are always enticing, however I usually stick with the pilgrim because as I said earlier, I'm addicted.
4926<>xx<>The atmosphere is so grunge, dark and even the people working there are not your average joes, which I love.
4927<>xx<>I always get a very interesting waiter and have a consistently good meal.
4928<>xx<>Actually, it's beyond good, it's mouth watering amazing.
4929<>xx<>The pastry always tastes fresh and is baked to perfection, and whatever you order to go inside of it is ALWAYS piping hot!
4930<>xx<>The wine sauce is to die for as well, so don't be suh with it!
4931<>xx<>And if you're still hungry by the time you're finished with your entree, which is almost impossible I've come to learn, the dessert menu looks incredible and I've had the peanut butter and jelly pasty (not as ordinary as it sounds) and it was a lovely way to end the meal!
4932<>xx<>I would recommend this place to anyone who loves comfort food, so basically everyone.
4933<>xx<>Enjoy!
4934<>xx<>I was told that this place had the best Hawaiian food around.
4935<>xx<>As a fan of L&L, which in my opinion is pretty good, I had to give this place a try.
4936<>xx<>DEFINITELY WORTH IT.
4937<>xx<>Service was fantastic.
4938<>xx<>The waitresses are very friendly.
4939<>xx<>Food: THE BOMB.
4940<>xx<>Portions are ENORMOUS.
4941<>xx<>Most of their entrees are $9, but for $11, you can choose two!
4942<>xx<>And the way they serve it is like getting two meals for the price of $11.
4943<>xx<>The best hawaiian food in Las Vegas, hands down.
4944<>xx<>Long over due to write a review for this place.
4945<>xx<>I've gone here for breakfast, lunch and dinner plenty of times.
4946<>xx<>Its a tradition now, to take guests visiting, for at least one meal.
4947<>xx<>The interior is fully decorated island style and staff are all hawaiians as far as I can tell.
4948<>xx<>Staff members are also very friendly and easily make you feel at home.
4949<>xx<>They always got local island music playing that just adds on to the experience.
4950<>xx<>My Favorites:  Chicken Katsu Loco Moco: Perfectly breaded chicken cut into strips, white rice, pair of over easy eggs and they're rich and thick homemade brown gravy (they're gravy is what sets them apart from every other hawaiian bbq eatery)  Loco Moco: Same as above except for the chicken, its a grilled homemade hamburger patty  Kalbi Short Ribs: Charbroiled, quite tender and soaked with flavor.
4951<>xx<>If the bone was edible, there would be nothing left..  Korean Chicken: fried little drumsticks and wings tossed in their special sauce.
4952<>xx<>Mild and uniquely flavorful, I can put these down!
4953<>xx<>Pork Chops: 2 pieces of grilled bone-in pork chops, topped with mushroom and onions.
4954<>xx<>I always get a side of their gravy and pour it over and smother the chops.
4955<>xx<>So So Comforting!
4956<>xx<>I've also tried their teriyaki beef and chicken, fried rice.. everything is great!
4957<>xx<>**Portions are HUMONGOUS!!
4958<>xx<>As the hawaiians say "Don't eat until your full, eat until you pass out"   **Full Entree Orders Will Easily serve 2!
4959<>xx<>Prices are very reasonable!
4960<>xx<>Service is great!
4961<>xx<>One of My Favorite Hawaiian BBQ Spots!!!
4962<>xx<>(and yes, I've been to L&L, Ohana, Shakas, the one in the California Hotel, Aloha Kitchen.. to name a few.. Not to mention some places in Hawaii itself)
4963<>xx<>Definitely the bomb.
4964<>xx<>If you like meat and hawaiian style meats this is the place to go.
4965<>xx<>This place is just like Da Kitchen on Maui except better.
4966<>xx<>After a long day of hiking at Red Rock, hubby and I stopped by here for dinner.
4967<>xx<>When you walk in, you're not immediately greeted.
4968<>xx<>Instead I got the feeling that you're supposed to be like family and seat yourself.
4969<>xx<>The environment is pretty laid back.
4970<>xx<>I actually felt like I was in Hawaii.
4971<>xx<>I ordered a combo with Korean short ribs and Hawaiian style pork.
4972<>xx<>It included a fat piece of the tender pork and 5 pieces of short ribs.
4973<>xx<>SO good and  very very very generous portions.
4974<>xx<>Flavor was all there.
4975<>xx<>I didn't touch the two scoops of rice.
4976<>xx<>Macaroni salad was typical.
4977<>xx<>Hubby ordered short ribs and katsu.
4978<>xx<>Katsu was well fried with a crispy outside.
4979<>xx<>I would definitely come back here again.
4980<>xx<>Don't forget the restaurant.com coupon!
4981<>xx<>Best authentic Hawaiian food in the US.
4982<>xx<>I am going with this bold statement because I have not had anything close to the food at Island Flavor.
4983<>xx<>The pulled pork, the ox-tail soup, and the loco mocos are awesome.
4984<>xx<>These meals come with a side salad(including macaroni salad) and rice.
4985<>xx<>The prices are great and one dinner can feed two people.
4986<>xx<>The portions are super huge.
4987<>xx<>If you can still muster up some more, their desserts are a good compliment.
4988<>xx<>The mud pie is super good!!
4989<>xx<>Enjoy!
4990<>xx<>This place is amazing.
4991<>xx<>So friendly, such amazingly authentic food.
4992<>xx<>I couldn't be happier knowing you guys are down the street with the best kalbi ribs in vegas.
4993<>xx<>With my fiancé from the islands, I've pretty much adopted Hawaiian food into my diet and trying every single Hawaiian restaurant in town has become a requirement for us.
4994<>xx<>Being that we both live in the west side of town, we usually don't stray too far from our frequent traveled routes, UNLESS it's to fulfill a foodie adventure.
4995<>xx<>On this particular day, we decided we'd finally pay a visit to Island Flavor.
4996<>xx<>When we arrived, I was immediately drawn to a plate of pre-made, saran wrapped musubis that sat on the register counter for 2 bucks a pop.
4997<>xx<>I thought to myself, how brilliant is that?!
4998<>xx<>We were seated and my eyes were drawn to one flaw-- Several teriyaki and sriracha sauce splatters on the wall.
4999<>xx<>I know, I know... Trust me, I HATE being a stickler for something like that, but it made me feel like a saw remnants of a booger flinger on the wall.
5000<>xx<>ANYWAY, back to the good stuff.
5001<>xx<>My fiancé and I ordered two mixed plates.
5002<>xx<>One beef teriyaki steak and korean chicken and one chop steak & onions and korean chicken.
5003<>xx<>When the plates arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the big portions.
5004<>xx<>Two scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad, and MEAT GALORE!
5005<>xx<>The food definitely tasted delicious.
5006<>xx<>However, as a fan of thinly sliced beef, I had expected my teriyaki steak to be sliced thin as described on the menu, but it was not.
5007<>xx<>It was actually the opposite of what I had expected--The chop steak was sliced thin and the teriyaki beef was more "chop[py]".
5008<>xx<>Nonetheless, I ate it.
5009<>xx<>I hope to visit them again soon to try a few more items off their menu.
5010<>xx<>I think maybe next time even consider sharing a plate to leave room for some of their desserts that I watched longingly pass my table.
5011<>xx<>Food was exceptional for the price!
5012<>xx<>Staff was absolutely superb!!!
5013<>xx<>Desert was good.....tad chilly so make sure you bring a light jacket when dining in.
5014<>xx<>Atmosphere reminds you of a cafeteria setting.
5015<>xx<>Overall a must go to if in the area!
5016<>xx<>There are not many restaurants by my house, so I was pleasantly surprised when I came across Island Flavor!
5017<>xx<>Some of my favorite dishes include their poke and chicken katsu.
5018<>xx<>I especially love that the portions are huge - great for leftovers!
5019<>xx<>This is the perfect restaurant to order to-go and enjoy a some authentic Hawaiian flavors.
5020<>xx<>After you eat here you will not eat any of Hawaiian theme style restaurant in town blows everything out of the water definitely is the king of Island food local Mocho is amazing come to think of it anything I've had  there is out of this world seven stars for me
5021<>xx<>The best hawaiin food in las Vegas belive me  This restaurant give You moré the what You  Expect for the price.
5022<>xx<>MY favorito is the oxtail soup And the ribs
5023<>xx<>Aside from strip clubs, slot machines, and hot weather, Las Vegas is known for its surprises.
5024<>xx<>You would think, that being in the middle of the dessert...nothing really happens.
5025<>xx<>Not so.
5026<>xx<>My new friend from China wanted Japanese food.
5027<>xx<>And I was on a budget.
5028<>xx<>This place was perfect, because for $24.95 you can have ALL YOU CAN EAT.
5029<>xx<>This is not like Riptide in Mission Viejo, CA where you can order a certain amount at a time.
5030<>xx<>Nope.
5031<>xx<>Nope here at KAYA you're allowed to order as much as you want or until your stomach explodes.
5032<>xx<>Their policy is that: the food you don't eat is what they'll charge you, maximum of 2 hours, the items with check marks- you can order only once.
5033<>xx<>My friend and I shared over 16 dishes.
5034<>xx<>All of them delicious.
5035<>xx<>Our sushi guy, Chase was fabulous!
5036<>xx<>We didn't know what to order or where to start, so he asked us a few questions and got the food rolling in.
5037<>xx<>Dinner starts around 4:30 and ends at 3:00 am.
5038<>xx<>Last food call is at 2:00 am.
5039<>xx<>I have a ton of photographs, but will upload when I'm in Cali.
5040<>xx<>For now, I highly recommend.
5041<>xx<>Your wallet will thank you
5042<>xx<>I'm not going to beat around the bush: this place isn't the best.
5043<>xx<>Their sushi was ok, but not nearly as good as Ichiza's (upstairs in this same place).
5044<>xx<>And the service seemed rather poor, too, which made the situation even worse.
5045<>xx<>I came here for a friend's birthday, and it was a letdown.
5046<>xx<>I know other people have had better experiences that I did, so I'm going to have to give it a try later on just to see if it's gotten better.
5047<>xx<>I hope so.
5048<>xx<>This place has hands down, THE BEST sushi I have ever had!
5049<>xx<>Some girlfriends and I were in Vegas for a friend's 25th birthday weekend and her party planner recommended that if we wanted sushi, to come here.
5050<>xx<>She said they had all-you-can-eat sushi and as soon as we heard that, we were sold!
5051<>xx<>I got miso soup, a cucumber salad, calamari, and 2 12-piece sushi rolls all for $20!
5052<>xx<>The soup, salad, and appetizers are also included in the $20 all you can eat price which was so awesome!
5053<>xx<>Everyone must go here at least once!
5054<>xx<>There were 8 of us girls and service was super fast, even though we ordered a lot!
5055<>xx<>Being in Colorado, there isnt really any sushi place i like here.
5056<>xx<>Coming from Hawaii, the standards were pretty high.
5057<>xx<>An okd friend told me about this place so we went and i had a blast!!!
5058<>xx<>The food was soooo good.
5059<>xx<>Sexy roll and viagra roll is my fave!!
5060<>xx<>LOL
5061<>xx<>this place is a little far for me, BUT it is DELICIOUS!!
5062<>xx<>its kind of hidden so you need to know how to get to it.
5063<>xx<>the atmosphere is great, very intimate, and a lot of beautiful art everywhere.
5064<>xx<>They also have some great lunch specials as well!
5065<>xx<>Tip: green tea iced tea, looks like algae but tastes sooooooo good!
5066<>xx<>Nope.
5067<>xx<>Not only Sushi Kaya offers sub-par food items, they are also expensive.
5068<>xx<>And as if it's not enough to beat up, the portion is small.
5069<>xx<>Since there are excellent Japanese restaurants like Yagyu and Ichiza in the same building, there's no reason to choose this place.
5070<>xx<>Nope.
5071<>xx<>This used to be my go to AYCE but it's been about 3 months since coming here and I now find myself highly disappointed and dissatisfied.
5072<>xx<>As always the service is good.
5073<>xx<>They are punctual and gear to take orders, refill drinks, and clear plates.
5074<>xx<>But it's not the service that I'm disappointed with, it's the quality of the food.
5075<>xx<>Much of the fish served here is precut and unfortunately I was getting slices that ranged from fresh looking and tasting, to old and tasteless.
5076<>xx<>The amount of rice they give with the nigiri is crazy.
5077<>xx<>The rice had a slight mush to it with little flavor.
5078<>xx<>The worst had to be the masago (smelt roe) and the scallop.
5079<>xx<>The Masago was mushy and didn't have any texture you would expect from fresh fish roe.
5080<>xx<>The scallop was clearly premade hours before and left to sit.
5081<>xx<>It's up in the air whether I am returning or not.
5082<>xx<>First time here and I really liked it.
5083<>xx<>I liked the different selection of food available.
5084<>xx<>I liked everything that I ordered except the last 2 which was the ultimate albacore & screaming orgasm roll...it was like eating wet rice.
5085<>xx<>The salad wrap was real good and refreshing.
5086<>xx<>Definitely will come back to try other food.
5087<>xx<>Nom Nom!
5088<>xx<>Me and my GF went there twice in a week at her prompting.
5089<>xx<>prices are competitive and the all-you-can-eat has a better than average selection.
5090<>xx<>You do have to pay per piece left over so Nommy Noms kiddies.
5091<>xx<>Service is a lil below average but certainly not terrible.
5092<>xx<>Great for Locals looking for a change of venue.
5093<>xx<>Transfriendly- A- just cause
5094<>xx<>I've been coming to Sushi Kaya for years and have always had a great experience.
5095<>xx<>Friendly service and food that appeals to all the senses put them head and shoulders above every sushi restaurant I've tried.
5096<>xx<>Put them on your 2Do list.
5097<>xx<>You'll be glad you did.
5098<>xx<>I could not even consider giving this place less then 5 stars.
5099<>xx<>First, the selection is diverse, and the food is of great quality and fresh.
5100<>xx<>There is not only a wide array of various food types and styles, but the dessert bar is also amazing, serving up creme brulee' and gelato!
5101<>xx<>My 2 favorite points:  -All you can drink beer and wine!
5102<>xx<>-The price per quality is out of this world.
5103<>xx<>$15 dollars for what I received was unreal (Lunch price).
5104<>xx<>I thought it was a trick, and was expecting a National Lampoons style buffet.
5105<>xx<>I was pleasantly surprised when i did not receive it.
5106<>xx<>There are many great buffets on the strip, however, the food here is amazing and given at an unmatchable price!
5107<>xx<>Enjoy at your own risk!
5108<>xx<>Came here for the $15/person lunch buffet.
5109<>xx<>I don't think you can get such great service and wide variety of foods at any other buffet except for this one!
5110<>xx<>And you can enjoy a great view of the desert while chomping on all of your food.
5111<>xx<>For some reason the coffee is excellent here - kept drinking cups of this while eating.
5112<>xx<>I wasn't a fan of the Asian food offerings but liked the paella and some of the fish they had.
5113<>xx<>The best part of the lunchtime buffet was the dessert offerings - they had creme brulee and tons of gelato, cheese cakes, and lovely little shot glass cups of creme, raspberries, and other delicious desserts.
5114<>xx<>It's way far from Vegas but worth it to drop by here since the resort is pretty and nice to walk around.
5115<>xx<>Chicagoan visiting here.
5116<>xx<>Wow, I have been there 2 times this year and both times failed to disappoint!
5117<>xx<>I am in love with their endless choices of seafood, meats and fresh veggies.
5118<>xx<>I'm not much of a crab leg person as my friends/family but this buffet has plenty of great options for you if that is the case!
5119<>xx<>I opted for their shrimp and prime rib, (my fav) and everything else in between.
5120<>xx<>You really have to pace yourself because it is impossible to try everything they have without drowning yourself, that or a heart attack, whichever comes first.
5121<>xx<>Then there are the desserts!!
5122<>xx<>O...M...G.... the desserts!
5123<>xx<>For someone who has a much of a sweet tooth as I do, this was indeed pure  HEAVEN.
5124<>xx<>They have all your regular stuff like cheese cake, cookies,  brownies, etc.
5125<>xx<>But then you move along the line and you see these cute little dessert cups nicely decorated and seemingly made just for you.
5126<>xx<>Yes, you!!
5127<>xx<>There's a fruit and custard/yogurt one, a tiramisu, one with banana... Yum.
5128<>xx<>The best part is, they are small so you can sample more without wasting or feeling as bad when you grab every....single... one to try.
5129<>xx<>heheh...Really, at this point there is no turning back, you may as well go FTW!
5130<>xx<>Then there is also creme brulee and flan (fav), and gelato at the very end (another fav).
5131<>xx<>Overall, I cannot think of any negatives of Studio B, except that I wish my stomach would stretch to accommodate my visits to you.
5132<>xx<>And also that you would move to Chicago..*sigh*til next time Vegas!!
5133<>xx<>!
5134<>xx<>Probably one of the best buffets i've ever eaten at!
5135<>xx<>It's a new spot, so everything is clean and has a modern interior.
5136<>xx<>Located inside the M resort 10 miles south of the Vegas Strip and just off the 15 freeway.
5137<>xx<>Their logo looks like the gmail logo.
5138<>xx<>Warning: cost = $40/person.
5139<>xx<>Highlights = pre-cut crab legs n butter, mussels, prime rib, gelato, mashed sweet potato, beer (try the cider!
5140<>xx<>), crab rangoon, all the other desserts.
5141<>xx<>There's a lot of other foods/desserts/drinks i have yet to try...
5142<>xx<>I like how the food is in the middle, so you don't have to walk too far.
5143<>xx<>This review is a little late as I went on Thanksgiving.
5144<>xx<>Mom's idea.
5145<>xx<>I had never been to a buffet anywhere on a holiday and the line for this place was insane and the price was about double what I'm guessing is normal at about $50 a person.
5146<>xx<>Had we had not had her handicap sign in our possession there is no way I would have stood in that!
5147<>xx<>That being said, our entry took about ten minutes from line to being seated in what I could tell was the handicap section near the front of the entrance and close proximity to the main buffet, the dessert section and the AYCD wine and beer.
5148<>xx<>I don't frequent many buffets but I have to say my Mom and I really enjoyed this one.
5149<>xx<>They had the typical Thanksgiving spread in addition to sushi, beef, chicken, etc., too many items to even name or remember.
5150<>xx<>I love the dessert bar as they were on the smaller side so it felt okay to try a couple different ones.
5151<>xx<>We had a great server who was funny and attentive.
5152<>xx<>Between trips to the buffet and chatting we spent about four hours there and never felt as if we were being rushed.
5153<>xx<>Bonus, no mess to clean up at home!
5154<>xx<>To die for.
5155<>xx<>Provided its by the state line of Nevada I would be willing to take the time to get there.
5156<>xx<>About a 10-15 min drive from the Las Vegas Strip  .
5157<>xx<>Our group did the $34.00 seafood dinner.
5158<>xx<>It was amazing.
5159<>xx<>Great seats right by the window.
5160<>xx<>You could get a great pic of the Las Vegas Strip.
5161<>xx<>I would probably frequent the place if it wasn't so far.
5162<>xx<>Get there early for dinner/seafood dinner on Friday or Saturday nights.
5163<>xx<>Strip buffets have really gone downhill over the years..  but off the strip @ the M is a different story.
5164<>xx<>I always make sure to be hungry on my drive home so I can stop here to eat!
5165<>xx<>Gamble a little and you can get a monthly mailer that should give you 2 line passes each month, very valuable during peak times... just read some of the reviews to see the kind of wait some people are enduring to eat here.
5166<>xx<>Normally I'd insert a joke about anyone waiting that long to eat a buffet, but not here.
5167<>xx<>Always good!
5168<>xx<>If the crab legs and cocktail shrimp weren't so weak, I'd give this place 5 stars.
5169<>xx<>3 stars alone for beer and wine included!
5170<>xx<>It's a bit off the strip but well worth the drive if you have a car.
5171<>xx<>The place is new, spacious, and the service is good too.
5172<>xx<>The prime rib was one of my favorites here.
5173<>xx<>*tip* you can only get one drink at a time so don't go up there trying to get 5.
5174<>xx<>Absolutely the best in Vegas.
5175<>xx<>The staff here are the nicest I've ever encountered.
5176<>xx<>Everyone of them is wonderful.
5177<>xx<>My wife and I went here for a lil evening snack and some wine.
5178<>xx<>We are big fans of the other Postino (LOVE the bruschetta).
5179<>xx<>This was my first time here and my wife's second.
5180<>xx<>We arrived at about 8pm and were seated right away.
5181<>xx<>The place kinda sorta looks just like their other location and had the same chill vibe going on.
5182<>xx<>The service was fast and friendly as always.
5183<>xx<>We each had a glass of wine and split the grilled cheese (totally random I know).
5184<>xx<>I am always impressed with their wine selection.
5185<>xx<>They have some good stuff that will appeal to just about everybody and it is all reasonably priced.
5186<>xx<>Anyway, the wine was good and the grilled cheese was just ok.
5187<>xx<>I'm not a fan of grilled cheese where the bread is real crispy and big.
5188<>xx<>Also, I'm not sure of the cheese they used but I wasn't a fan either.
5189<>xx<>It was just eh.
5190<>xx<>It wasn't horrible, but I won't order it again.
5191<>xx<>Hmmmm....maybe if it came with a bowl of tomato soup ....  My only gripe about this location as well as their other one is the parking.
5192<>xx<>It is ALWAYS a clusterfuq.
5193<>xx<>I mean good for them for always being so busy, but it really is a pain in the ass.
5194<>xx<>Great place.
5195<>xx<>The staff was very friendly and attentive.
5196<>xx<>The food was great.
5197<>xx<>The sandwiches were huge.
5198<>xx<>The butchers block.
5199<>xx<>Great selection of charcuterie and cheese.
5200<>xx<>The goat cheese was awesome.
5201<>xx<>We also got the bruschetta, the first four in the menu.
5202<>xx<>Everything was delicious.
5203<>xx<>Came for brunch today at Postinos and it sure didn't disappoint!
5204<>xx<>Had the B.E.L.T.
5205<>xx<>which is Bacon Egg Lettuce and Tomato on ciabatta with dijonaisse and it was amazing.
5206<>xx<>And they had no problem making it with egg whites just like I love it.
5207<>xx<>My husband had the egg and bacon which he said was perfectly done.
5208<>xx<>My son had it with regular eggs and they were made perfectly.
5209<>xx<>One companion had the salmon and eggs and loved it.
5210<>xx<>Another had the scones with an egg and bacon.
5211<>xx<>The scones were light and just right--not dry like some scones can be.
5212<>xx<>And the devonshire sauce was incredible.
5213<>xx<>Our dishes all came with a lovely fruit bowl.
5214<>xx<>I had the Mimosa which was lovely and at $5--a bargain.
5215<>xx<>I totally love Postinos for lunch and now it's my new favorite for an affordable and DELISH brunch!
5216<>xx<>Not one of our meals was over $10!
5217<>xx<>So worth the price of admission!
5218<>xx<>I went here with a group of people on Friday night.
5219<>xx<>This was the first time I have been to the Central location, and this Postino's is set up more like a bar setting.
5220<>xx<>Good layout, friendly staff, great people watching.
5221<>xx<>We had some drinks, I love that they have Franzikaner there as my bf and I love it.
5222<>xx<>I also had a turkey panini which was exceptionally good.
5223<>xx<>I had a mixed greens salad as well and I found it to be a bit salty.
5224<>xx<>A little too much going on there.
5225<>xx<>I wish they had a larger menu, but hey, no big deal.
5226<>xx<>This place is so cool and comfortable I feel like I could go there by myself and be happy as a clam.
5227<>xx<>I'm going to try to make it to Postino's more.
5228<>xx<>This place is addictive and is going to get me into trouble.
5229<>xx<>The wine by the glass list is small but very good, when the food arrives it's even more interesting and tasty than you expected when you read about it on the menu (excluding the bruschetta which I found uninteresting), but I think the best thing is that this is a great place to hang out for an afternoon.
5230<>xx<>Staff are friendly but not in a goofy way, helpful when you need without being condescending and, unlike so many wine bars, professional in appearance and behavior.
5231<>xx<>Good people watching with a pretty diverse clientele.
5232<>xx<>I haven't done my usual Saturday chores for two weeks now, instead finding excuses to hang out here all afternoon.
5233<>xx<>baaaaaad  I prefer this location to the one on Campbell because it's airier and has better service.
5234<>xx<>Recommendations?
5235<>xx<>If you can't decide, get The Plate which has bits of all kinds of things, all of which are wonderful.
5236<>xx<>Try the sparkling sauvignon blanc for a nice change from the typical white wine.
5237<>xx<>And of course try to do so before 5pm to get your wine for $5.
5238<>xx<>I must post a note on Postino's because it needs to be a part of my life.
5239<>xx<>It should be THAT place where "everybody" knows your name or that Go To spot when family and friends are in town and you want to make some kind of an impression.
5240<>xx<>Recently met some girlfriends there for Happy Hour (which runs from 11 am to 5 pm daily) and our servers, Patrick and Kristen, made the experience even better.
5241<>xx<>They were so positive and attentive but in a way that was not obnoxious.
5242<>xx<>Postino's atmosphere felt as if you were sitting at your friend's kitchen table.
5243<>xx<>It's spacious, well lit and the decor is not heavy.
5244<>xx<>Man, their meals are big.
5245<>xx<>If you go, it's better to share even though the price is reasonable.
5246<>xx<>I'd like to suggest that you valet park and make sure you have cash to tip the attendants.
5247<>xx<>It took me 10 minutes to parallel park my car, but that's beside the point I'm trying to make here...tee hee.
5248<>xx<>Love this place for it's great drink selection and bruschettas.
5249<>xx<>You really can't go wrong with any choice you make, but the hummus and artichoke dip are my favorite.
5250<>xx<>It's a great place to go to with friends or your honey.
5251<>xx<>Grab a seat outside on the patio on a nice day!
5252<>xx<>As an L.A. girl I've seen it al in the dining sector but this architecturally hip Phoenix patio home turned open air bar was a nice surprise.
5253<>xx<>Fresh farmer's market ingredients and simple combo's put the focus back on the food and taste.
5254<>xx<>I loved the tomato and mozzarella, bruschetta selection and extension affordable wine list.
5255<>xx<>The locals I was with hit it weekly and I can see why.
5256<>xx<>Cute graphics on their menu/interior too.
5257<>xx<>Never had a bad meal or wine there.
5258<>xx<>One of the best places in Phoenix.
5259<>xx<>Never did I expect a little place on Central to be so busy on a Wednesday night, so much so that they offered Valet parking because the lots were full.
5260<>xx<>I had an enjoyable time sitting on the patio.
5261<>xx<>Definitely need to go back to try their wine selection since I could not partake last night.
5262<>xx<>I only had time and an appetite for something small so I chose the Bella Postino.
5263<>xx<>Warm artichoke spread, white bean hummus and MJ Breads.
5264<>xx<>The spreads were tasty, the bread not so much.
5265<>xx<>I imagine the bread would have been heavenly (after all it is MJ's!)
5266<>xx<>if it had been fresh and soft, but alas it was day old and crispy.
5267<>xx<>Not a big fan of crispy bread.
5268<>xx<>Perhaps next time I'll make mention and have the bread subbed out with soft fresh bread.
5269<>xx<>Looking forward to visiting again and trying some other items and wine !
5270<>xx<>Whenever I come to Vegas, there are only a couple of places I crave to go.
5271<>xx<>Jean Phillippes, Firefly, and Serendipity.
5272<>xx<>I have a sweet tooth so you can see why I rated this restaurant 4 stars.
5273<>xx<>Simple American staple foods with a little flare to it and their frozen hot chocolate is a must if you'venever had it.
5274<>xx<>If you bring a friend or two with you, I'm confident that ordering one frozen hot chocolate will satisfy three people.
5275<>xx<>I love their brownie sundaes, big portions of ice-cream, fudge, and brownies.
5276<>xx<>This is a perfect place to go in Sin City if you want to indulge in your food pleasures.
5277<>xx<>So...my traveling companion and I saw these amazing looking desserts earlier in the week and opted to try this place a few days later for lunch.
5278<>xx<>I wasn't too hungry, so I got the tomato soup with a side of waffle fries and my friend got the veggie burger.
5279<>xx<>While my friend really enjoyed her veggie burger, I didn't care too much for my soup/fries since I got a killer tummyache after eating here....we also split a frozen hot chocolate, which was tasty, but wayyy too big for us to even think of finishing!
5280<>xx<>The food was pretty pricey, so next time I think I'll go elsewhere for lunch/desserts...service was not too fantastic either and they could definitely use a busboy!
5281<>xx<>The hostesses and waitresses were pretty busy and it took them a while to seat us since none of the tables had been cleared or cleaned off.
5282<>xx<>If you are in line around 11pm, they will give you a sign to hold to tell the rest that they are closed.
5283<>xx<>For doing that, you will get a free Frozen Hot Chocolate.
5284<>xx<>I don't know if it is worth it because  a lot of people came and we had to do all the explaining saying that we were the last one in line.
5285<>xx<>So $11 for a frozen hot chocolate that taste like a chocolate slush to me.
5286<>xx<>I don't think its worth it, but hey you gotta try it once right.
5287<>xx<>Nothing too special.
5288<>xx<>went here for my birthday with a group of friends - we had the patio practically to ourselves, and the food servings are enormous!
5289<>xx<>the frozzzzen cocktails are delish.
5290<>xx<>only downside was that service was a bit slow.
5291<>xx<>Really good food!
5292<>xx<>Came here with a group of people and shared our food so we were able to have a little of everything.
5293<>xx<>Will come back next time!
5294<>xx<>Keeping this short and sweet.
5295<>xx<>Go for the desserts, skip the meals/food here.
5296<>xx<>There food isn't anything that has wow factor, but as others has said it's typical American fare but jacked up about $5 a plate.
5297<>xx<>This place is always super busy as well so either go at an "odd" time or when you're not starving.
5298<>xx<>Pros: -The desserts!
5299<>xx<>It's what their reputation was built on... -The pinky pink décor, it makes you feel like you're in a sweet shop -Our server was very nice and attentive  Cons: -Pricey - you're on the strip...at the foot of Ceasar's Palace you pay for that locale -The food wasn't worth the price; it was good and freshly prepared but so is Applebee's and IHOP.
5300<>xx<>They just have prettier plating.
5301<>xx<>-Always busy, expect a min 20min wait -Don't get the Frozen Hot Chocolate with alcohol, it's expensive and you will NOT get a buzz (if that's what you were expecting.)
5302<>xx<>Tips: Park Valet at Ceasar's and tell them you're going to Serendipity.
5303<>xx<>The valet was totally full but when we pulled up and said that we just were going there, they gave us this special valet card and were only steps away versus parking in the garage and being .5 miles away.
5304<>xx<>Unfortunately, this time around we weren't able to get a table due to the longggggggggggggg wait, but the "to-go" food order area was just fine.
5305<>xx<>(i dunno wtf to call it lol)  You can not go wrong with the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!
5306<>xx<>The hype is all true and it's definitely worth it!
5307<>xx<>Don't listen to negative reviews about it until you try it... for real...  Their regular fries there are hella bomb too!!
5308<>xx<>The only reason I give this place a 4 is because of the expensive prices & long wait :(
5309<>xx<>This place is awesome!
5310<>xx<>Great outdoor atmosphere and great food.
5311<>xx<>My wife and I went there for a late breakfast.
5312<>xx<>I had the breakfast burger, which was amazing!
5313<>xx<>Next time I'm in vegas, I'll definitely get it again.
5314<>xx<>My wife ordered the lucky 7, which was a ton of food for one person.
5315<>xx<>Of course we ended the meal with the frrrrozen hot chocolate!
5316<>xx<>I would highly recommend this place.
5317<>xx<>i'm not going to tell you this place is amazing, or heaven in my mouth becuz its not like i've had everything on the menu and know for a fact it all is wonderful.
5318<>xx<>but from the few things that i was fortunate enough to try here, it sure seems that way.
5319<>xx<>prices are very decent for the portion sizes!
5320<>xx<>everything is usually under 20 dollars but is big enough for two people to definitely share.
5321<>xx<>i for one love the hangover omelet i think it is.
5322<>xx<>its like 10 dollars about, comes with seasoned potato wedges on the side.
5323<>xx<>it is the best omelet i have ever had!
5324<>xx<>i mean, it comes with french fries INSIDE of it!
5325<>xx<>what???
5326<>xx<>who does that!
5327<>xx<>GOD does.
5328<>xx<>i am pretty sure God cooks french fries into his omelets.
5329<>xx<>definitely recommend if your an omelet eater.
5330<>xx<>the other thing i was completely surprised by was the strawberry waffles...they were so good i want to cry!
5331<>xx<>they come with freshly made whipped cream, strawberries, and syrup(which i didn't even need they were so perfectly sweet already) i mean, i don't even LIKE waffles and i'm telling you to try them.
5332<>xx<>you will not be disappointed unless are the type of person that doesn't like sweet and creamy perfectly combined and sprinkled with unicorn sparkles.....but hey, its not for everyone.
5333<>xx<>another good thing, frozen hot chocolate.
5334<>xx<>i've had plain, peanutbutter, and mint chocolate!
5335<>xx<>all have been to die for.
5336<>xx<>i really don't need to say more.
5337<>xx<>just buy it.
5338<>xx<>i also had their strawberry banana smoothie which was even better than my favorite smoothie from jamba juice...sorry jamba.
5339<>xx<>it was only the one time i swear!
5340<>xx<>best thing about sprinkles was the service!
5341<>xx<>first time i went there, i was really impressed.
5342<>xx<>our food took a little longer to come out than we thought it should but we didn't even say anything about it, our waitress just came over and apologized and when it came time to order the frozen hot chocolates, we were debating between two of them so she brought out both and comped one because of the wait.
5343<>xx<>very nicely done!
5344<>xx<>MUST TRY if you have a major sweet tooth!
5345<>xx<>The Frozen Hot Chocolate is definitely something you must try.
5346<>xx<>That in itself earns this restaurant 4-stars.
5347<>xx<>The ambiance of the restaurant is very playful yet chic.
5348<>xx<>Imagine big swirly lollipops; humongous gum ball machines; black, pink, and white accents everywhere.. frills and just all things girly!!
5349<>xx<>I also really like their outdoor patio seating.
5350<>xx<>It's right on the Strip, so you can still see the hustle and bustle of Vegas.
5351<>xx<>We mostly go there for the desserts, but I've tried their burgers a few times.
5352<>xx<>I must admit, the food is a bit overpriced.
5353<>xx<>You're essentially paying for the atmosphere and presentation of the food.
5354<>xx<>However, portions are fairly large too!
5355<>xx<>Since the first time I have visited GB, it has warmed up quite a bit--- I am not certain they have the proper A/C unit for this space..... seriously, it was an OVEN in there multiple times this summer.
5356<>xx<>So these 2 stars are just for the SWAMPY feeling and massive heat stroke I nearly experienced in GB.
5357<>xx<>I will not be returning until AFTER the summer....
5358<>xx<>This is such a cool restaurant.
5359<>xx<>Very fun and lively, you can tell everyone at all of the tables is having a great time.
5360<>xx<>I loved the staff and i think the menu is just so unique and awesome.
5361<>xx<>All the meals that were ordered at my table were prepared to perfection and i have never been to another mexican food restaurant that is so unique and exciting to be at.
5362<>xx<>I will recommend this place to everyone and it makes for a great night out.
5363<>xx<>Also, the margarita's are so perfect.
5364<>xx<>They have a little bit of kick to each sip and it was a great drink with my meals.
5365<>xx<>I LOVE THIS PLACE
5366<>xx<>Loved the food, but the service was awful.
5367<>xx<>Totally ignored and my husband had to get up and walk to find someone to take our second drink order.
5368<>xx<>Also, very loud with the concrete floors and cinder brick walls.
5369<>xx<>Lots of staff, but poorly trained on how to take care of customers.
5370<>xx<>Busy for a Sunday evening out so that was a good sign.
5371<>xx<>Hip vibe but not pretentious or "too cool" vibe.
5372<>xx<>Note, you can order to go and take your meal to the rooftop of the hotel to which it's attached.
5373<>xx<>We had a friendly server but did get lost in the shuffle towards the end of our meal.
5374<>xx<>However, it got slammed when we were wrapping up our meal and do not begrudge the servers for that.
5375<>xx<>The food was excellent.
5376<>xx<>The guac was chunky with a more citrus flavor.
5377<>xx<>Tacos were a great spin on street tacos.
5378<>xx<>I had a fish, a shrimp and a carne asada.
5379<>xx<>The carne was crisp and then chewy.
5380<>xx<>The shrimp had just enough kick.
5381<>xx<>The fish was tilapia that night and that was citrisuy and had a bit of avocado for a refreshing flavor.
5382<>xx<>The elote as an app was deliciously bad for you as it should be.
5383<>xx<>Our party of three shared the elote as we just wanted a taste, but this is easily edible for one hungry person.
5384<>xx<>Our friend had the chicken burrito which was ginormous.
5385<>xx<>If we had room, I would've stayed to try dessert.
5386<>xx<>Good for parties up to 8 people.
5387<>xx<>Excellent, fresh Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, especially during happy hour.
5388<>xx<>Their guacamole is chunky, fresh, and original, with pieces of orange in it that add a nice, unexpected citrus sweetness...probably second best in the city to only Barrio Cafe.
5389<>xx<>The chicharron de queso is unique, and the dipping sauce is outrageously good, but be sure to share it with a couple other people unless you can eat a lot of crispy fried cheese cracker yourself.
5390<>xx<>Tacos are all very tasty - the carne asada is a must, marinated so that it's tender, juicy, and slightly sweet.
5391<>xx<>The casual atmosphere and friendly service round this place out as pretty darn good.
5392<>xx<>Great food and cool ambiance but it fails in the realm of "bang for the buck".
5393<>xx<>I can get a really good and substantially bigger taco at the right street vendor in town or I can get a better, albeit three times pricier at a 1/3rd the size, taco here.
5394<>xx<>It's a question of economic utility here.
5395<>xx<>By the way, I like your bathroom.
5396<>xx<>I like the Clarendon a lot.
5397<>xx<>There's a rooftop bar, a really awesome pool, a cool feel to it, a lounge, and they have events that seem fun.
5398<>xx<>My friends and I come here for lunch from time to time, and I've been in the evening a few times  as well.
5399<>xx<>The bar service is Ok depending on the night in which you go.
5400<>xx<>I've gone a lot of Saturday nights and had great service most of the time, although there was one night the service was incredibly slow.
5401<>xx<>I like the drinks and have eaten in the cafe just a few times.
5402<>xx<>The dishes I've ordered are just OK, nothin' special.
5403<>xx<>The fruit salad had a lot of apples and very few strawberries (yes I know apples are cheaper).
5404<>xx<>I had recently ordered a crepes dish that was supposed to have a specific cream sauce with plantains.
5405<>xx<>I was disappointed to see that the crepes were covered with cheap-o spray can whipped cream and bananas!
5406<>xx<>Not the same.
5407<>xx<>I was craving some plantains.
5408<>xx<>The guac is OK with greasy chips, but I've had better restaurant guac.
5409<>xx<>I typically enjoy a sangria or a wine.
5410<>xx<>One of the people in my group had ordered a drink and said it sucked, though.
5411<>xx<>I like the ambience of the place, mainly because I am usually with a large group of friends.
5412<>xx<>It can get loud during certain evenings.
5413<>xx<>I used to come a lot of Tues evenings but haven't been a while.
5414<>xx<>Saturdays can get busy, as expected, but the lounge is a chill area to hang out while waiting for a table, and the wait staff leave us alone till the table is ready.
5415<>xx<>I love the rooftop bar area, especially during the cooler months.
5416<>xx<>Sometimes the heat lamps aren't on, though.
5417<>xx<>It's open late, and it's usually not busy.
5418<>xx<>Ensalada cortada- nice mix of kale and greens with corn nuts.
5419<>xx<>The small was quite small.
5420<>xx<>The shrimp and verduras de temporada tacos are quite good; nice seasonings and mix of flavors although not the best I've ever had.
5421<>xx<>I got the picoso cocktail by accident and that was delicious; I should have stuck with it instead of my original order of the pisco sour cocktail.
5422<>xx<>While it was strong the pisco itself is only mediocre-tasting.
5423<>xx<>I have had MUCH better @Raymi in NYC.
5424<>xx<>There is also a new draft white wine on the menu called Tazi (I think).
5425<>xx<>It is terrible, utterly terrible.
5426<>xx<>Even our waitress spit it out in the bushes after tasting it!
5427<>xx<>Otherwise great service and very cool interior decor and nice outdoor seating space.
5428<>xx<>I convinced my family to eat at this place (before trying it) when we drove to Phoenix to visit my cousin, so felt a weird sort of pressure eating here...    ***disclaimer: vegetarian rating***     Ingredients are fresh, and it's nice that they make a conscious effort to support local farms.
5429<>xx<>I ordered the vegetable taco, grilled corn, and an order of fries.
5430<>xx<>The way that the tacos are brought out was a little awkward, as multiple tacos are tightly fitted in a silver taco tray, and the wait staff have you pluck out your choice as it's brought around.
5431<>xx<>Mine seemed to have been stuck in the tray somehow, and I ended up leaving a heap of the fillings behind before I finally got it into my plate, but anyway, it was fine...
5432<>xx<>I'm not big on certain grilled vegetables (zucchini, squash, chunks of corn), and wished that it had been a simple traditional taco with beans instead of meat, but still... it was light and the seasonings were good.
5433<>xx<>The corn on the cob was really good, and something I'd like to eat again, as were the fries, which came with a really great dipping sauce.
5434<>xx<>I also ordered the agua fresco, which was honeydew, I believe.
5435<>xx<>Very, very nice.
5436<>xx<>Refreshing.
5437<>xx<>All things considered, I'd give this place a 3.
5438<>xx<>Not my favorite Mexican eatery, by any means, but probably better if I ordered something with meat.
5439<>xx<>At a red light, in the sunshine, on a Sunday...
5440<>xx<>I had the huevos rancheros accompanied by a Bloody Mary and a Kiltlifter.
5441<>xx<>Everything was amazing and the prices were extremely satisfactory!!
5442<>xx<>I will be back!
5443<>xx<>Maybe every Sunday!
5444<>xx<>:o)
5445<>xx<>A friend brought me here and everything I had was excellent.
5446<>xx<>We ordered the roasted brussels sprouts, roasted corn pizza and a meat/cheese ravioli with some sort of cranberry sauce (it was a special).
5447<>xx<>All were super delicious.
5448<>xx<>I also recommend the peppered pear martini.
5449<>xx<>I'd go back in a heartbeat, I want to try everything else on the menu!
5450<>xx<>Also, the valet parking is super handy since the parking lot is so small.
5451<>xx<>I'm happy to hand over my keys and let someone else take care of it.
5452<>xx<>Went in on with idea of eating someplace we'd never been before but have always been curious about.
5453<>xx<>Starting with the location, excellent spot, very centric and near everything in central Phoenix.
5454<>xx<>The facade with the star wall is excellent marketing and identity management technique since they also use it as a brand stamp throughout, also really cool looking.
5455<>xx<>Entry is cute with the little organic veggie gardens growing.
5456<>xx<>Inside is cute although the chairs in the main tabled dining area were rather uncomfortable.
5457<>xx<>Waiter was good, and a great atmosphere, pretty people, a good place to go on a date.
5458<>xx<>Now the good stuff.
5459<>xx<>We tried two pizzas 12 in.
5460<>xx<>The marguerita was delicious n very stretch melty cheese, fresh basil and warm juicy tomatoes on the crispy clean dough was excellent.
5461<>xx<>Tried the Funghi pizza and was VERY delicious!
5462<>xx<>The special and delicate flavors of the wild mushroom and truffle oil came out nicely and were the centerpiece of the pizza.
5463<>xx<>They are a bit pricey, and honestly considered going to oreganos down the road for bigger bang for the buck, but stayed to humor our craving for  some high priced gourmet pizza.
5464<>xx<>Beats Picassoz blandness any day.
5465<>xx<>Definitely recommend it for going on a date, or hanging out with a pretty, cool friend.
5466<>xx<>:)
5467<>xx<>I love it when the server smiles so much you feel like you walk out of the restaurant a better person.
5468<>xx<>That happened tonight.
5469<>xx<>I am partial to The Parlor especially since I am partial to the Nello's in Ahwatukee where Eric Mei got his start.
5470<>xx<>We adore Eric and adore The Parlor.
5471<>xx<>Tonight we got frito mixto, cauliflower, and cavatappi.
5472<>xx<>So worth the drive!
5473<>xx<>Yay!
5474<>xx<>This was a great dinner date with the husband.
5475<>xx<>The location is much bigger than it appears when driving past.
5476<>xx<>Same goes for the parking.
5477<>xx<>One of the reasons I had avoided coming in was worry about parking and size.
5478<>xx<>Not to worry, it was fine!
5479<>xx<>Husband was happy to get an italian beer, I was happy with a nice cocktail.
5480<>xx<>Our salads were delicious and very large (the small is perfect for one person for a meal, esp with meat).
5481<>xx<>Husband was very happy with his personal size pizza (happy hour for the win!).
5482<>xx<>Dessert was lovely; I loved the little donuts (cherry) with caramel sauce.
5483<>xx<>It was heavenly!
5484<>xx<>This is great place to come as a group or for a family outing since it's easy to do sharing.
5485<>xx<>A large salad could be a side for about 4-6 people, I would say.
5486<>xx<>The smaller version could cover about 3.
5487<>xx<>Certainly a place we'll recommend when the whole family is in town over Christmas and is looking for a place to eat.
5488<>xx<>Party of 3, a Thursday, 7 ish.
5489<>xx<>The review is perfect...meh, it was just ok.  On the positive + - a great space, especially the patio dining area - friendly service  Room for improvement-   - I would say that everything we had was ok.
5490<>xx<>Solid food, but nothing stands out in my mind.
5491<>xx<>- Pricey and a 'scene', so be ready for a wait on the weekend.
5492<>xx<>I get that it used to be a beauty parlor and still has some exposed pipes and the salon chairs for the bar.
5493<>xx<>Is it me or is that where the similarities end?
5494<>xx<>Bottom line...if I were in the area, I would probably try something else since I have already been there.
5495<>xx<>Date night!!
5496<>xx<>I immediately assumed that there would be a wait here tonight, considering that it's a Saturday night and as soon as we pulled in, there was no parking spot in sight and valet parking boys waiting for us.
5497<>xx<>I was wrong.
5498<>xx<>They took us the car and we were sat instantly.
5499<>xx<>What we had?
5500<>xx<>The 12" Salcicca (with caramelized onions) and Barbecue Chicken pizzas with Hibiscus lemonade and Calamari for appetizer.
5501<>xx<>Talk about delicious!
5502<>xx<>While we scarfed down the pizzas, we were comparing the quality of the ingredients of Parlor vs. Cibo vs. Pizzeria Bianco.
5503<>xx<>Although it was really REALLY good pizza, we both voted that Cibo is our FAV still.
5504<>xx<>Why?
5505<>xx<>Because the cheese, meats, and everything in general tasted fresher at Cibo, and the crust here was a little harder and more burnt here.. (if you're into that kinda thing).. but this place still kicks ass.
5506<>xx<>The ambience of the low lighting, misters outside, and cooling AZ weather made it a perfect night for awesome, unique pizza.
5507<>xx<>Thumbs up.
5508<>xx<>The Parlor, I loved it in so many ways because they take care of you on all levels, food, service & it's a nice spot to hang with your friends.
5509<>xx<>Thanks Yelp, I would not have known of this place if it was not for you & my fellow Yelpers.
5510<>xx<>Yep, as good as it gets for sure.
5511<>xx<>First time I ordered out from here for work.
5512<>xx<>Drawback.. the salads aren't pre tossed in the dressing.
5513<>xx<>Obviously to keep from being soggy upon pick up but the dressing they supply is more than what they would toss with if you ate on site.
5514<>xx<>Unfortunately I trusted the portions they gave me would recreate the "on site" salad and I ended up drowning my poor salad into a soggy mess.
5515<>xx<>Also I had to tell the boy packing the order not to put the burgers in with the salads.
5516<>xx<>Hello?
5517<>xx<>Isn't that "Working in a restaurant 101"  n'est ce pas?
5518<>xx<>Spanish chorizo stuffed squash blossom antipasti rocks.
5519<>xx<>Crazy busy and loud bar.
5520<>xx<>Potato pizza is good, get the egg on the pizza you won't be disappointed!
5521<>xx<>The "valet" in the parking lot was the first tip-off.
5522<>xx<>I thought it would be an isolated part of the experience, but it was not.
5523<>xx<>I'm all for valet, but when "valet" means moving my car 10 feet next to other cars that self-parked, that's a bit pretentious.
5524<>xx<>So, apparently is the whole restaurant.
5525<>xx<>Don't get me wrong... not pretentious in a tuxedo-wearing-waiter sort of way.
5526<>xx<>No, this is Arizona pretentious... overpriced dishes, mediocre quality, smallish portions, and staff that can't wait to jump out of their shells to tell you how their food is "made with love" and every other BS line they have.
5527<>xx<>When the owner came by the say hello, he started with "hey, man, I'm Erik and this is my place".
5528<>xx<>"My place"?
5529<>xx<>What, is this his living room?
5530<>xx<>If I'm buying a $19 salad with chicken, I don't want to be called "man" and greeted by shaky-wristed guys wearing graphic T-shirts delivering my salad ("you did order the salad, right sir?
5531<>xx<>", before setting it down).
5532<>xx<>If you like the Vig or any of the other pseudo-pretentious "hot spots" that populate Phoenix these days, maybe this is your place.
5533<>xx<>The atmosphere is nice from a decor standpoint, although I know that anyplace decorated that way is d-bag central.
5534<>xx<>I'm all for nice service but not fake nice.
5535<>xx<>Read my other reviews and you'll see I'm not into "the scene".
5536<>xx<>My psychoanalysis on The Parlor, other than the food is very average and even a bit bland, is that it's the place soulless people go to convince themselves they're not soulless because they had a conversation with their waiter about hair pom and told the lifeless, dull-as-dishwater hostess they bought their girlfriend the same pair of jeans.
5537<>xx<>For $19, I'll get a salad at the Phoenician and actually have a conversation with the young server about world travels.
5538<>xx<>If The Parlor didn't have seven waiters all serving you different parts of your dinner so that you could have such a conversation, I doubt the paper-thin likability would last long.
5539<>xx<>This restaurant is worth every penny!
5540<>xx<>The service was superb, the food was beyond my wildest highest expectations and they have absinthe.
5541<>xx<>The absinthe was the main reason we chose this restaurant, not knowing that the food would be amazing.
5542<>xx<>The one dish that you must absolutely order is the FOIE GRAS BRULEE.
5543<>xx<>Holy crap!!!
5544<>xx<>I mean where else can you order that dish?
5545<>xx<>No where else that I know of.
5546<>xx<>The Maine Lobster Agnolotti and the shortribs were also top notch.
5547<>xx<>Even the house bread (bacon bread) was to die for.
5548<>xx<>We ended the night with absinthe for dessert.
5549<>xx<>Our first experience...
5550<>xx<>Tasted kind of like licorice and although it's pretty mild going down, it's like over 100 proof alcohol.
5551<>xx<>Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
5552<>xx<>Full review in the blog.
5553<>xx<>Highlight courses below.
5554<>xx<>I must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.
5555<>xx<>High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word "sexy" comes to mind immediately.
5556<>xx<>With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a "casino restaurant."
5557<>xx<>Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.
5558<>xx<>Beginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.
5559<>xx<>Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.
5560<>xx<>Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.
5561<>xx<>Already abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.
5562<>xx<>Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.
5563<>xx<>Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.
5564<>xx<>As good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.
5565<>xx<>Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.
5566<>xx<>Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.
5567<>xx<>Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.
5568<>xx<>My sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.
5569<>xx<>Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.
5570<>xx<>With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.
5571<>xx<>Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.
5572<>xx<>Warm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.
5573<>xx<>Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.
5574<>xx<>Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.
5575<>xx<>The first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.
5576<>xx<>Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.
5577<>xx<>We've been to Sage twice, in Jun 2010 and in Jan 2011.
5578<>xx<>Both times were outstanding.
5579<>xx<>Sage is our current  "special occasion dinner" place.
5580<>xx<>The first time, my S.O.
5581<>xx<>had oysters w/ tequila mignonette; braised veal cheeks w / confit peppers "piperade", picholine olive and shaved fennel salad.
5582<>xx<>I had the organic beets salad w/ duck prosciutto; scallops w/ braised oxtails, wild mushrooms, salted caramel reduction.
5583<>xx<>Every bite was perfect.
5584<>xx<>The second time, we had the tasting menu.
5585<>xx<>The amuse bouche was country pate w/ pickled harricot verte.
5586<>xx<>The courses were oysters; beef tartar; hamachi w/ roasted cauliflower (unorthodox but wonderful combination); lobster roll;  braised beef shank.
5587<>xx<>Dessert was apple strudel w/ ice cream; peanut butter brittle.
5588<>xx<>Another outstanding experience.
5589<>xx<>Came on a Friday early evening.
5590<>xx<>Wouldn't seat us until the entire party was there, not a good way to start, but the bar staff was good and they did seat us promptly.
5591<>xx<>On a one aside shame on the aria concierge for saying they had vegan options.there weren't.
5592<>xx<>Anyways may I recommend the foie gras custard as a must order.
5593<>xx<>As for the main course I went for a fish dish that was executed very well.
5594<>xx<>The waiter was great and helped accommodate our vegan friends.
5595<>xx<>Definitely a place to go to
5596<>xx<>love this place  i was somewhat sick when i went so my stomach hates me for not being a bigger food whore when i went.
5597<>xx<>however i was in rome so i had to do my best to be a roman  the farm poached egg appetizer with truffles is STELLAR.
5598<>xx<>loved it.
5599<>xx<>the chix entree was great and sous vide  the grilled octopus salad was great but if i could do it over i'd get the pear salad.
5600<>xx<>i wish the octopus was charred a bit more but that could be changing the dish completely  service was stellar and 5 stars.
5601<>xx<>kitchen was sending lots of great stuff.
5602<>xx<>decor is gorgeous  one friend got the veal which was phenom as well  ORDER: Waitress JEANS: OK but dont show up in a t shirt or shorts or flippers.
5603<>xx<>I went to sage resturant at aria for second time I had great food and great service  my favorite Mediterranean resturant at aria resort
5604<>xx<>Came here for dinner with a friend and wow were we impressed!
5605<>xx<>Service from our waiter and all other employees was amazing and unlike most restaurants, they folded my napkin whenever I left the table to use the restroom and helped me up from my seat.
5606<>xx<>Recommendations and food were impeccable and cooked to perfection.
5607<>xx<>Definitely suggest the tartare.
5608<>xx<>Wonderful restaurant!!!
5609<>xx<>Awesome decor, loved the purple murals.
5610<>xx<>Great service as well.
5611<>xx<>Tried their prix fixe menu.
5612<>xx<>Oysters, scallops, wagyu sirloin, milk chocolate cremeux.
5613<>xx<>All really good.
5614<>xx<>One of the best in vegas.
5615<>xx<>Certainly the best restaurant in Aria.
5616<>xx<>Thursday, December 22, 2011 at 5:00pm: Party of 4: My Second Visit  Sage was the finest dining experience I have ever had.
5617<>xx<>I wore my finest suit for the occasion.
5618<>xx<>We were greeted by a friendly hostess and were escorted into the lounge.
5619<>xx<>The artwork and decor were classic 1920's / 1930's.
5620<>xx<>The purple and gold hues with low lighting set the mood.
5621<>xx<>We were escorted into the restaurant.
5622<>xx<>My wife and I were in two chairs while the other couple loved the bench seating wrapped around a column.
5623<>xx<>The menus were easy to read.
5624<>xx<>Throughout the evening, the staff met all of our needs.
5625<>xx<>The ones who stood out to me were James, John and Pablo.
5626<>xx<>They were attentive, quick, personable and knowledgeable.
5627<>xx<>The meal was outrageous.
5628<>xx<>The warm bacon bread roll and sourdough baguette with creamy butter and sea salt created an obviously salty taste to the level I wanted.
5629<>xx<>My wife and I followed that up with the Shaved Brussels sprout salad with pears, macadamia nuts, and a vinaigrette.
5630<>xx<>It was sweet and tangy.
5631<>xx<>Slow-Poached Organic Farm Egg: Smoked Potato / Shaved Summer Truffles / Toasted Country Bread.
5632<>xx<>It was warm and soothing.
5633<>xx<>The Pacific Yellowtail Crudo: Shaved Trumpet Mushrooms / Black Summer Truffle / Toasted Pine Nuts.
5634<>xx<>The yellowtail was cool and the pine nuts created a nice texture in combination with it.
5635<>xx<>Side note: Truffles go great with the last two items.
5636<>xx<>My main course was the Iberico Pork Loin: Milk-Braised Cannelloni / Baby Eggplant / Creminelli Mortadella.
5637<>xx<>The meat, pasta, vegetable combination was great.
5638<>xx<>The meat was soft and had a special flavor.
5639<>xx<>I had to read a little about Iberico Pork Loin, because it was so good.
5640<>xx<>It's even a specialty in Spain (Iberian Peninsula).
5641<>xx<>We didn't get the dessert this time, but we were here in July 2011 and the dessert was excellent in presentation and in taste.
5642<>xx<>We started the day in an Aria Sky Suite with a view of the Strip watching the sunrise over the mountains just to the left of the Mandarin.
5643<>xx<>We had breakfast at the Cafe Vettro and spent the day in Aria.
5644<>xx<>This was end of a perfect day and the beginning of a wonderful evening before going to see a show at 7:00pm.
5645<>xx<>Way over priced for quality but that's Vegas.
5646<>xx<>Had to ask for the $59 early dinner menu (server seemed to "forget" they had one).
5647<>xx<>Corn soup was good, fish was an attempt to be creative but fell flat and dessert (pineapple something) was way too sweet and uninteresting.
5648<>xx<>Service was good, better restaurants for the price.
5649<>xx<>Chef seems to preoccupied.
5650<>xx<>John, I am right with you on this one.
5651<>xx<>First off the Pros:  Bottomless wine, lobster(although limited to half a lobster/ person), clean, wait service was real good, and the desserts.
5652<>xx<>Cons:  Food was par at best, bland and greasy, a bit pricy for the food that was served.
5653<>xx<>Straight forward, the food was ok.. nothing special although they had crab legs, lamb, and prime rib.
5654<>xx<>There were both pretty dry and I'm not usually the biggest fan of au jus.
5655<>xx<>I had a plate and a half of random foods and nothing that especially peaked my interest including their crab legs.
5656<>xx<>So I decided to go straight to dessert, I mean truthfully no one can screw up anything with sugar in it right?
5657<>xx<>Because of my huge sweet tooth, the desserts definitely hit the spot after a standard meal.
5658<>xx<>The banana foster was yummy, some chocolate cake was also really good, I also got some of the ice cream or gelato (don't seem to remember), and a number of their cookies.
5659<>xx<>If what you need is dessert, than this place will indeed suffice.
5660<>xx<>I would rather make the drive to M resort where prices are cheap and food is better than Aria and the desserts are also bomb!
5661<>xx<>Or the Wynn/Bellagio buffet.
5662<>xx<>Spring the extra cash wouldn't be much in this case as we paid about 35 a pop at Aria.
5663<>xx<>All the meat was poor quality and overcooked.
5664<>xx<>The dim sum was OK, great cured meats and cheeses.
5665<>xx<>The shellfish was awful and the crab legs with ghee was my favorite part.
5666<>xx<>The dessert selection is great but many poorly executed dishes.
5667<>xx<>I only went because of proximity,  would not go back, and think it was very overpriced for the quality.
5668<>xx<>I'm pretty confident that the Aria buffet has solidified my idea that big name Vegas buffets totally aren't worth it.
5669<>xx<>A friend of a friend suggested that, "Duuude.
5670<>xx<>the Aria brunch buffet is sick brah, for real."
5671<>xx<>So we wrangled up all 11 of the troops and dragged our butts across the street, in the rain and cold, up and down those annoying Vegas hanging walkways...only to pay $30 for a barebones sad-ass buffet.
5672<>xx<>Ok, heads up here.
5673<>xx<>These people charge an automatic 18% gratuity on parties larger than 9.
5674<>xx<>Don't get hosed like we did and split your group in half.
5675<>xx<>All they're going to do is push together two tables of 5!
5676<>xx<>Why are we tipping them anyhow when we're doing all the footwork of bringing the food to the table?
5677<>xx<>Be careful, they'll also try to con you into buying the champagne brunch...they don't tell you that the alcohol is an extra $7 charge.
5678<>xx<>Food was kind of on par with Mc.
5679<>xx<>Donald's.
5680<>xx<>Textures were off, proteins were crazy dry.
5681<>xx<>Hash browns suck...and were chewy.
5682<>xx<>And don't you dare touch that sushi!
5683<>xx<>Day old sushi does not a buffet make!
5684<>xx<>The only thing i thoroughly enjoyed was the lovely fluffy waffles and maple syrup.
5685<>xx<>Okay, let's be serious here, Aria: you can't slap the label "GELATO" on tubs of generic ice cream.
5686<>xx<>Don't you dare put nuts in apple pie, either!
5687<>xx<>BLASPHEMY!
5688<>xx<>I feel cheated.
5689<>xx<>I feel like this should get zero stars...but it should get a Bonus star for having a gorgeous hotel to walk through to compensate for a less-than-stellar experience.
5690<>xx<>This place is sooooooo damn good!!
5691<>xx<>My family was so happy with all the food.
5692<>xx<>Prime rib, raw oysters, claims, mussels, crab, etc....ALL OF IT WAS GREAT!!!
5693<>xx<>I can't wait to go back!
5694<>xx<>It's expensive but worth it!
5695<>xx<>Went for Christmas dinner with my family so the holiday price was RIDICULOUS but we had no complaints..we ate until we couldn't eat anymore.
5696<>xx<>WE LOVE FOOD!
5697<>xx<>!
5698<>xx<>i really enjoyed the buffet at the aria.
5699<>xx<>my husband and i had complementary lunches here when we arrived.
5700<>xx<>the selection was really great and there were a few items that stood out for me, the mini ban mi sandwiches, the pad thai, and i love that breakfast was still an option.
5701<>xx<>and if you love desserts, the dessert selection was amazing.
5702<>xx<>one of the best that i've seen in vegas.
5703<>xx<>the red velvet whoppie pies were so good!
5704<>xx<>we decided to eat here again right before we left vegas and the selection changed up a little since it was closer to breakfast, but still great options.
5705<>xx<>I haven't tried enough buffets in Vegas to give this place 5 stars, but I suspect it might be worth it.
5706<>xx<>We came here because it was a package deal with Zarkana tickets, but if you're looking for a buffet that's worth the price I feel like Aria's is good.
5707<>xx<>My only real Vegas comparison is the buffet at the Wynn, which comes highly recommended by others, but I thought this one was much better.
5708<>xx<>quick note.. i'm not really into buffets.. i prefer quality over quantity.. and this buffet just wasn't very good..   although it wasn't very busy.. it took at least 15 minutes to get seated.. there was a decent selection of food.. nothing really stood out... nothing was truly awful..
5709<>xx<>I love their buffet here!
5710<>xx<>Prime Rib, Crab Legs, BBQ Ribs, Oxtail, Salmon Poke, Shrimps and a variety of different kinds of cheeses were my highlights!
5711<>xx<>Their prime rib is nicely cooked, BBQ rib sweetly grilled and tender and oxtail well marinated in stew!
5712<>xx<>To a point that the meat is smoothly falling off the bone!
5713<>xx<>Smacking delicious!
5714<>xx<>Plus, you got the seafood part!
5715<>xx<>Unlimited amount of shrimps with cocktail dips and chopped up crab legs for you to hover over!
5716<>xx<>Zest it up with lemon wedges and it will be perfecto!
5717<>xx<>Desserts, desserts!
5718<>xx<>Do try their ice cream flavors and their delectable creme brûlée!
5719<>xx<>They also have good looking cake pops that can entice you to just pop it in your mouth!
5720<>xx<>Oh my goodness!
5721<>xx<>This place is a buffet lover's haven!
5722<>xx<>Compared to the other buffets I ate at...Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Wynn.
5723<>xx<>I would say that this one is the best.
5724<>xx<>They have a wide selection of food, and all of them are kept really nice and hot.
5725<>xx<>What I would recommend skipping would be the mexican food.
5726<>xx<>I've tried all the dishes at the Mexican section and none of them were good.
5727<>xx<>Maybe its just me...but I would just skip it!
5728<>xx<>The chinese section is definitely accurate, it's not just some asian fusion thing, but real chinese food.
5729<>xx<>The pasta is also great!
5730<>xx<>You choose what you want in your pasta, and they make it for you!
5731<>xx<>It was very delicious..and the portion is huge.So I would recommend sharing the pasta with someone else so that you have more room for other food.
5732<>xx<>The place is really modern, and its in a clean setting.
5733<>xx<>I went for the dinner on a Saturday and it was around $25-$30..can't really remember.
5734<>xx<>But I would definitely go here again seeing how the other buffets were like!
5735<>xx<>This is up there with Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Rio.
5736<>xx<>Its brand new obviously and its got plenty of fresh food and selections.
5737<>xx<>They have unlimited wines and lobster for dinner.
5738<>xx<>During the day they have unlimited champagne or bloody marys.
5739<>xx<>The food is really fresh and they have it all from seafood(shrimp, crab legs, sushi, etc).
5740<>xx<>I had the lamb and some spinach salad thing that was bomb.
5741<>xx<>They had some good gourmet pizza too and I dont usually like that style since I am from CHICAGO orginally.
5742<>xx<>They also had some really good yogurt that really hit the spot.
5743<>xx<>The pricing was pretty decent actually not as much as Bellagio or Rio and if you sign up for the ARIA welcome package you get $75 food and beverage credit anyways so it was all free for us.
5744<>xx<>Definitely going back!
5745<>xx<>Prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at Scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our Vegas trip.
5746<>xx<>There were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience.
5747<>xx<>We made reservations for 6:30 on Thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the Bellagio fountains.
5748<>xx<>We got the last one available.
5749<>xx<>The only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains.
5750<>xx<>Oh well.
5751<>xx<>We ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range.
5752<>xx<>The waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling.
5753<>xx<>The bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread.
5754<>xx<>We didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:  1) The first course was yellowtail and tuna sushi.
5755<>xx<>The yellowtail was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly.
5756<>xx<>The tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms.
5757<>xx<>Everything was light, fresh, and flavorful.
5758<>xx<>An excellent way to start a meal.
5759<>xx<>A crispy fritto misto came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.
5760<>xx<>2) The second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top.
5761<>xx<>- The capers were a bit salty for my liking, so I pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh.
5762<>xx<>my.
5763<>xx<>goodness.
5764<>xx<>That scallop was the best I've ever had.
5765<>xx<>The crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth.
5766<>xx<>The small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level.
5767<>xx<>3) The chef added in course number three - creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms.
5768<>xx<>My biggest complaint here is that I can never eat anyone else's polenta again.
5769<>xx<>Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it.
5770<>xx<>My friend and I dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses.
5771<>xx<>If nobody had been watching, I would have licked the bowl.
5772<>xx<>We took a little break before moving on in the meal.
5773<>xx<>4) The pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal.
5774<>xx<>After seeing Scott Conant revered as the King of Spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about.
5775<>xx<>The simple spaghetti dish was amazing.
5776<>xx<>I have never had pasta so perfectly al dente.
5777<>xx<>There was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't.
5778<>xx<>It was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes.
5779<>xx<>It was just pasta perfection.
5780<>xx<>HOWEVER, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful.
5781<>xx<>The horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard.
5782<>xx<>This is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.
5783<>xx<>5) The next course was a black cod with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel.
5784<>xx<>Perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.
5785<>xx<>6) Spiced duck breast with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious.
5786<>xx<>The duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish.
5787<>xx<>7) Dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish.
5788<>xx<>The only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate.
5789<>xx<>My friend and I polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.
5790<>xx<>If you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.
5791<>xx<>When you are in Las Vegas you have more choices for great food than anywhere else in the U.S. sorry New York but let's be honest some food there sucks.
5792<>xx<>This place is a for sure try.
5793<>xx<>The Caesar salad is fantastic....
5794<>xx<>The bread you get before your meal comes with 3 dipping sauces and is a nice touch.
5795<>xx<>A wide variety of gourmet dished with the chicken being my favorite.
5796<>xx<>wow this place was really good.
5797<>xx<>As much as i love trying restaurants that they dont already have in LA (pretty new), id heard about Scarpetta when I was visiting NY so we decided to check it out.
5798<>xx<>I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli which ws delicious!
5799<>xx<>a real winner!
5800<>xx<>They were so flavorful that even John (notorious for his 5 minute meals)  was forced to eat slowwwly.
5801<>xx<>I also ordered the sea scallops- so juicy!
5802<>xx<>& the veal was alright, nothing to write home about.
5803<>xx<>I wish i had known to request the table with the views of the fountain!
5804<>xx<>We were sitting by the wall, but that was ok.
5805<>xx<>I would definitely come back, this place is one of the better restaurants in lv at its price point.
5806<>xx<>Not worth the price.
5807<>xx<>The food was fine but we had a much better meal (food and service) at Todd English at 1/2 the price and twice the wine.
5808<>xx<>Picture four girls who have been drinking all day downstairs at the Marquee Day Club, starved out of their minds.
5809<>xx<>Not really the way I imagined myself dining for the first time at the famous Scarpetta, but hey, at least I was ready to eat.
5810<>xx<>We crawled in in our flip flops and denim shorts right when the restaurant opened.
5811<>xx<>The tables were already all booked (at 6pm!
5812<>xx<>), but they have some nice booth seats by the bar.
5813<>xx<>First off, the complimentary bread.
5814<>xx<>My god.
5815<>xx<>Warm and chewy, stuffed with sausage or spinach and cheese, with olive oil for dipping.
5816<>xx<>We had to get a second round of this, it was so fantastic.
5817<>xx<>We also shared four pastas: - spaghetti (with tomato and basil, that's it!)
5818<>xx<>- duck & foie gras ravioli - pici (with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto) - short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (the toasted breadcrumbs added such a fabulous texture and crunch!)
5819<>xx<>All the dishes were phenomenal, but the spaghetti was by far my favorite.
5820<>xx<>Typically spaghetti doesn't do it for me, but now that I know what it's supposed to taste like, I've changed my mind.
5821<>xx<>So simple, yet so delicious.
5822<>xx<>It was cooked perfectly al dente, and so rich and full of flavor I didn't even miss the creaminess (or cheesiness) of other pastas.
5823<>xx<>A MUST-VISIT IF YOU'RE EVER IN VEGAS!
5824<>xx<>Scarpetta is an excellent restaurant, but it is also extremely overpriced.
5825<>xx<>The portion sizes are very small and the prices are ridiculous.
5826<>xx<>I started my meal off with the roasted diver scallops.
5827<>xx<>These are served with sunchokes, pinenuts, gremolata and mushrooms.
5828<>xx<>Awesome appetizer...fresh and delicious.
5829<>xx<>For my main course, I ordered perigord black truffle tagliatelle.
5830<>xx<>This truffle was definitely amazing, I was just disappointed in the quantity.
5831<>xx<>They put literally three small shavings in my dish of plain pasta (no vegetables...nothing) and this cost $65.
5832<>xx<>I understand that 1 oz of these truffles is $60-100, but at the same time they could have at least put 5 or 6 shavings.
5833<>xx<>I thought this was a total rip-off.
5834<>xx<>I mean this is black truffle, NOT even white truffle!
5835<>xx<>I have been to other high-end restaurants where I pay the same price and they will literally shave a whole truffle into my pasta.
5836<>xx<>Next time, I will boil my own plain pasta at home and order these truffles online.
5837<>xx<>The cost will be the same but at least I will be getting what I pay for...VALUE!!
5838<>xx<>For dessert, I ended my meal with the amedei chocolate cake served with gelato and salted caramel sauce.
5839<>xx<>Rich and luscious dessert to finish off the night.
5840<>xx<>I recommend checking out Scarpetta for dinner, just avoid ordering the black and white truffles and be sure to bring a full wallet!
5841<>xx<>The host seated our party so we got the full view of the bellagio fountains.
5842<>xx<>The foie gras ravioli was my favorite.
5843<>xx<>The flavor was rich with the right amount of sauce.
5844<>xx<>I wished the portion was bigger.
5845<>xx<>Wished California didn't ban foie gras as well.
5846<>xx<>The duck was good as well.
5847<>xx<>Crispy skin and super soft on the inside
5848<>xx<>The final meal of our Vegas escapade was well spent at Scarpetta.
5849<>xx<>It wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, I had nothing but a good time.
5850<>xx<>Attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the Ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.
5851<>xx<>We started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu.
5852<>xx<>Upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right.
5853<>xx<>That was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.
5854<>xx<>We started with a sashimi plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=YvhgCFf5CQSIopYC83uWwA) which consisted of yellowtail with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions.
5855<>xx<>The other half of the plate sat the tuna susci - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables.
5856<>xx<>The fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced.
5857<>xx<>The bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli.
5858<>xx<>As part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood fritto misto for this course.
5859<>xx<>Perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.
5860<>xx<>The next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop.
5861<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=06QYvnXBie8HfTnYKN4OBw) It was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop.
5862<>xx<>The chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew.
5863<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=gtRWGpR4xggHmw0rVryaNw) For the record I hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta.
5864<>xx<>Yet, I could not stop eating this polenta.
5865<>xx<>The flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta.
5866<>xx<>(I suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what Chef Scott Conant lets on) It was a nice double headliner with the scallop.
5867<>xx<>Next up was the pasta course and Chef Conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti.
5868<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=JQRLJQ4G8BgIzxS0bC8Bow) Fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed.
5869<>xx<>While I thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the short rib agnolotti with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=wzfcOlEkTVylois628h_Ag), totally blew my mind.
5870<>xx<>Wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime?
5871<>xx<>I miss it already as I speak.
5872<>xx<>The next course was the black cod.
5873<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=2TmOcEavT5T4aeu8J6ItRA) Again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle.
5874<>xx<>The fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel.
5875<>xx<>Delicious.
5876<>xx<>The next entree course was a the duck breast.
5877<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=BR1FRH72URaVJtrhiq6w-A) While this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night.
5878<>xx<>The orange and spices (I kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck.
5879<>xx<>All in all, a successful combination.
5880<>xx<>Final course and dessert was a chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and caramel.
5881<>xx<>(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=uDi5aPZQgQwUQcGjVUkoSg) This is where I really had to throw in the towel after all that eating.
5882<>xx<>The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent and I could only finish half of it but I just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste.
5883<>xx<>It was just delicious.
5884<>xx<>You can totally taste the toasted flavor.
5885<>xx<>Now on to the kink of the night.
5886<>xx<>Since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine.
5887<>xx<>Each single time, he let the door hit me as I was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize.
5888<>xx<>Not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner.
5889<>xx<>Still for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and I strongly recommend Scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.
5890<>xx<>The most expensive spaghetti I've ever eaten.
5891<>xx<>But the BEST I've ever eaten.
5892<>xx<>Don't be fooled by the baseball-sized portion.
5893<>xx<>It fills you up (must be the carbs..mmm..).
5894<>xx<>Handmade noodles cooked PERFECTLY al dente and the clean and fresh sauce..   Their polenta is delicious as well.. And pretty much all their bread with their little accompaniments.
5895<>xx<>It's carb heaven.
5896<>xx<>But heard the duck ravioli sucked.
5897<>xx<>Just saying.
5898<>xx<>Nothing like fresh pasta made in house!
5899<>xx<>Came here with girlfriends and had top notch service.
5900<>xx<>We all chose a buddy and split our apps/entrees, and Scarpetta was nice enough to halve our plates for us!
5901<>xx<>Definitely recommend the truffled foie gras ravioli!
5902<>xx<>The wine list was beautiful but appallingly marked up (300%).
5903<>xx<>So we brought our own vino!
5904<>xx<>($35 corkage fee)
5905<>xx<>Great food!
5906<>xx<>I would have given a 5 stars but the table, chairs, bathroom and one of our cool aid mugs was dirty.
5907<>xx<>I will still come to this place though.
5908<>xx<>Breakfast simply CANNOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!
5909<>xx<>Yeah, the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is cute and the restaurant is super clean, but the real reason people make the pilgrimage to Lolo's is for the fantastic food!
5910<>xx<>The chicken and waffles are delicious!
5911<>xx<>There are so many combinations based of chicken and waffles on the menu that allow you to choose based on how much you want to eat.
5912<>xx<>The fried chicken is homemade and the meat melts in your mouth.
5913<>xx<>The waffles are huge and they too are homemade and are divine.
5914<>xx<>This is a great place to bring company from out of town.
5915<>xx<>Long live Lolo's!
5916<>xx<>Wow.
5917<>xx<>For a place that is known for fried chicken and waffles, I expected better.
5918<>xx<>Maybe I came at the wrong time?
5919<>xx<>But they weren't making the fried chicken to order, even though it wasn't busy.
5920<>xx<>I sat at the counter in front of the kitchen and saw the giant sheet tray full of pre-cooked chicken.
5921<>xx<>So, as expected, it had been sitting there awhile and was dry, dry, dry.
5922<>xx<>The waffle wasn't even that good, even though that was fresh.
5923<>xx<>Seriously don't understand what the hell everyone is thinking by going to this place.
5924<>xx<>KFC has better fried chicken than here - at least it's juicy.
5925<>xx<>Great place!I'm 6'0, 215lbs and the plate that I got was too much for me to finish and I was starving.
5926<>xx<>The waitress was very nice as well.
5927<>xx<>No matter what you order to drink it'll come in a Mason jar.
5928<>xx<>The food was great and the chicken was not greasy at all.
5929<>xx<>The cool thing is they leave you alone enough to eat and enjoy your food without ignoring you, great balance in customer service.
5930<>xx<>The only bad thing is I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale from my home in Chandler!
5931<>xx<>You can't go wrong when you can get comfort food and Southern hospitality until midnight.
5932<>xx<>Chicken, waffles, grits, greens, corn bread?
5933<>xx<>Yes, please; all of the above plus some purple drink, too!
5934<>xx<>I'd avoid the early weekend mornings when the crows do their walk of shame.
5935<>xx<>When I first heard about this place months ago, I never thought I would be interested.
5936<>xx<>I don't like southern or fried foods.
5937<>xx<>Then I saw a write up in the newspaper where people voted on their chicken versus some fried chicken from some fancy place....and it was pretty much a split decision.
5938<>xx<>The descriptions of the food made me want to try it.
5939<>xx<>So we went last night (Friday night) for the first time to the Scottsdale location.
5940<>xx<>It was busy, but we we still sat immediately.
5941<>xx<>I was starving and the smell was wonderful!
5942<>xx<>I ordered the Betty Boop (one waffle and one breast) and Sierra Mist.
5943<>xx<>They do not serve alcohol here.
5944<>xx<>It comes in a huge mason jar.
5945<>xx<>I tasted the Kool Aid which was yummy too!
5946<>xx<>We also ordered the macaroni and cheese.
5947<>xx<>The chicken and waffles came out first.
5948<>xx<>The mac and cheese didn't come out until we were almost halfway done with our meal, which was a little strange.
5949<>xx<>The fried chicken was absolutely amazing!!
5950<>xx<>It was perfectly cooked.
5951<>xx<>The chicken was so tasty.
5952<>xx<>The fried part isn't overwhelming and greasy.
5953<>xx<>I am definitely a fan of fried chicken now!
5954<>xx<>The waffle was good, nothing special, but the sweetness did complement the saltiness of the fried chicken.
5955<>xx<>I wouldn't order the mac and cheese again.
5956<>xx<>It was a small portion in case you are thinking of sharing.
5957<>xx<>But it was too cheesy for my liking.
5958<>xx<>I liked that the manager came around and asked how our meal was.
5959<>xx<>She seemed to genuinely care what we thought of it.
5960<>xx<>I liked the food so much that I went again the next day with my two daughters!
5961<>xx<>The place is kid-friendly, although there is not a kid menu.
5962<>xx<>I ordered both of them full plates, which I probably shouldn't have.
5963<>xx<>They could have easily shared one.
5964<>xx<>They loved it as well--and the kool aid!
5965<>xx<>I would definitely recommend this place!
5966<>xx<>I never thought it would be somewhere I would like, but I will definitely go back.
5967<>xx<>Best chicken ever!
5968<>xx<>And cute t-shirts too...
5969<>xx<>You really do "gotta go go to Lo Lo's!"
5970<>xx<>Just follow the dancing chicken leg you won't be disappointed.
5971<>xx<>Seriously though, some of the best Southern food I have ever eaten, you know, aside from my grandmother's who was born and raised in North Carolina and wasn't stingy with the bacon grease when cooking.
5972<>xx<>They clearly use quality ingredients and make everything from scratch, you can taste it!
5973<>xx<>I highly recommend the collard greens, fried okra, and especially the banana pudding!
5974<>xx<>The fries were good too but you have so many other choices for sides that you just can't get  anywhere else so go with one of those options.
5975<>xx<>The service was also fabulous!
5976<>xx<>Our server was very polite and his face must hurt so bad by the end of the shift because he never stopped smiling.
5977<>xx<>You should go just for the novelty of asking "What types of Kool Aid are you serving today?"
5978<>xx<>Ohhoho man, I love America.
5979<>xx<>I gathered two of my other, uh, "rubenesque" ladies to try this place for the first time.
5980<>xx<>I wanted almost everything on the menu, so the best option was obviously the Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter.
5981<>xx<>There are a few ways to get it, but I did mine with the chicken fried chicken smothered in sausage gravy white sausage gravy (loaded with "flavor" they say), mac & cheese, string beans and potatoes.
5982<>xx<>Sure, I probably had more than my share of fat and salt for the week, but I enjoyed it!
5983<>xx<>The chicken was the star, juicy and crispy, and there was so much sausage in the gravy, even I was stunned.
5984<>xx<>The mac & cheese was good as well, so cheesy that I couldn't manage more than a couple bites (gotta save room for the chicken!).
5985<>xx<>The green beans and potatoes were there to make me feel like I ordered a vegetable, but weren't very good, and the cornbread was dry.
5986<>xx<>I tried a bite of my friend's waffle, and even though I've never cared for waffles, I enjoyed it.
5987<>xx<>Despite what many reviewers noted as a lack of or just bad service, we were all happy with our waiter and didn't have to wait overly long for our food.
5988<>xx<>Lo-Lo's is the ultimate chicken and waffle spot..not only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeat..as you watch TV and listen to some music that will make you want to eat
5989<>xx<>Friendly staff, amazing food!
5990<>xx<>Good drinks and good food- Garlic Edamame was delicious  Chicken bowl was amazing Chicken tacos were good Beef bowl has a lot a yellow curry flavor but still good
5991<>xx<>Might be my new favorite place to hang out on Central, be a part of the "scene" and eat some really great food.
5992<>xx<>The staff was friendly and helpful.
5993<>xx<>My Hawaiian Margarita was awesome.
5994<>xx<>Too bad I was the DD...one was not enough.
5995<>xx<>Everyone at the table had something unique and different and we all loved it.
5996<>xx<>Can't wait to go back and try something else.
5997<>xx<>It was scrumptious!
5998<>xx<>I've never had a bad time at Hula.
5999<>xx<>The drinks are some of the best mixes in the valley.
6000<>xx<>Be careful though, they pack a helluva punch.
6001<>xx<>From the burgers to the Mongolian beef bowl to their ceviche, you can't pick a bad dish.
6002<>xx<>They set out to be a throwback 50's style tiki bar and they nail it.
6003<>xx<>But, if you really want to enjoy yourself, sit at the bar.
6004<>xx<>John (the tall guy) is hands down one of the best bartenders in the valley.
6005<>xx<>Somewhere the art of that job got lost.
6006<>xx<>The fun, easy to talk to, quick witted bartenders have been in large part replaced with a surly, too busy to chat, cooler than you crowd that makes it hard to be a repeat customer anymore.
6007<>xx<>Not at Hula.
6008<>xx<>Some people think that five stars are too commonly given out.
6009<>xx<>I think five stars are deserved when it's a place you've recommended *first* when somebody asks you where to go downtown.
6010<>xx<>Hula's been that more than once.
6011<>xx<>We have some new friends who have never ridden the light rail.
6012<>xx<>The 4 of us decided to take a trip downtown and pick a restaurant that was an easy walk and one the we could enjoy for less than $50 a couple with a few drinks.
6013<>xx<>After doing the required internet searches we ended up at Hula's Modern Tiki on a Friday night in July.
6014<>xx<>We arrived around 6:30 and wanted to eat inside (they have a cute outdoor patio) as it was still a hot.
6015<>xx<>We were the first ones on the waiting list and created a seat at the bar.
6016<>xx<>Cute place filled with Hawaii type memorabilia.
6017<>xx<>My wife's Mai Tai was very good which can be a challenge to find in Phoenix.
6018<>xx<>We were seat in about 15 minutes.
6019<>xx<>The wait staff was adequate.
6020<>xx<>The spicy edamami was actually spicy and I ended up eating most of it.
6021<>xx<>We ordered the Ahi Taco's and the Carne Asada Taco's.
6022<>xx<>Each were two large taco's stuff with Ahi tuna and steak cooked to order.
6023<>xx<>There was enough for 3 or 4 taco's each.
6024<>xx<>Delicious.
6025<>xx<>My wife enjoyed the black bean and rice combination and she doesn't do beans.
6026<>xx<>The concrete floors make the atmosphere a little noisy but not obnoxiously so.
6027<>xx<>The 4 us were able to carry on a "real conversation".
6028<>xx<>I also notice a manager type "floating around" obviously paying attention to the details.
6029<>xx<>It showed.
6030<>xx<>I later introduced myself to the manager (Dana) who turned out to be the owner.
6031<>xx<>I always enjoy a restaurant where the owner/manager is actively involved.
6032<>xx<>The price came in right at $40  and we all agreed we would go back again.
6033<>xx<>It would be a really fun place on the patio when the weather cools.
6034<>xx<>Modern Tiki is a pretty good way to describe this place.
6035<>xx<>Big windows, very open, beachy deco feel.
6036<>xx<>The first thing you will notice is the huge patio with the fire pit in the middle, so nice!
6037<>xx<>Especially this time of year in Phoenix, it's great to sit outside.
6038<>xx<>Also for those of you nonsmokers you wont have to fight for clean air, as the smoking section is separate around the corner.
6039<>xx<>They have some pretty delicious drinks, very decently priced as well.
6040<>xx<>I had their Pink Bikini, vodka infused pineapple and watermelon, pretty dangerous.
6041<>xx<>My friend had the Blood Orange that was very good as well.
6042<>xx<>We had a few appetizers from their late night menu, which is served until midnight or so.
6043<>xx<>They take a fun different twist on modern/normal bar aps.
6044<>xx<>We had the fish cakes, similar to a crab cake, but way better!
6045<>xx<>And their calamari, which was fantastic.
6046<>xx<>I can't wait to go back!
6047<>xx<>I'm torn on this rating.
6048<>xx<>Two stars is "Meh, I've experienced better.
6049<>xx<>", and I have.
6050<>xx<>Three stars is "A-OK", which it  was.
6051<>xx<>Had the manager not compensated me for the ridiculously small plate of ribs I got, this review would be scathing.
6052<>xx<>But he did make it mostly right and that went a long way towards fixing the overall experience to a third star.
6053<>xx<>But two things about the third star:  I shouldn't have to feel like a cheapass by wondering if I got a full rack or a half rack.
6054<>xx<>The food didn't feel like anything special, which would have been acceptable if the prices were far lower.
6055<>xx<>Two stars it is.
6056<>xx<>Our party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area, a little lost for a good place to go.
6057<>xx<>I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night, which it definitely is.
6058<>xx<>Tonight, we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch.
6059<>xx<>However, i'm having difficulty with this whole hipster thing where the wait staff dresses in  street clothes.
6060<>xx<>It weirds me out and it's almost insulting for as expensive as the place is.
6061<>xx<>I totally dig the overall ambience.
6062<>xx<>The restaurant itself appears to be in a rehabbed auto mechanic's shop, creating something totally unique in a region of unique rehabs.
6063<>xx<>The comfortable patio hangs right off Central Avenue, creating a rare big-city kinda place in Phoenix.
6064<>xx<>The fire pit is just cool, they play good and fun music.
6065<>xx<>Ambience is about the one thing about this place that actually lines up with the price, contributing solidly to Uptown's burgeoning vibe.
6066<>xx<>The beer selection felt weak.
6067<>xx<>We didn't order cocktails, so I can't comment on that.
6068<>xx<>Going through our courses....The potstickers were good, but the thai peanut sauce just tasted weird.
6069<>xx<>The spicy edamame was an interesting twist but I didn't find myself very hungry for it   My friend ordered the cajun burger which he thought was "mediocre."
6070<>xx<>I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic, altho the fries and slaw were pretty good.
6071<>xx<>The meat, yeah I wolfed it down, but in the end it didn't seem like anything to write home about.
6072<>xx<>The food and drink, all in all, felt more or less average.
6073<>xx<>The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food.
6074<>xx<>Given the other choices in the area that I still need to try out, I don't see much of a reason to come back for dinner again.
6075<>xx<>We entered Hulas Modern Tiki and immediately felt the wind Leave our sails.
6076<>xx<>This A Frame style building resembles a cabin more than a tiki bar.
6077<>xx<>Very sterile and no cozy island vibe.
6078<>xx<>I ordered a Mai Tai.
6079<>xx<>It arrived sour and unpalatable.
6080<>xx<>The waitress offered to replace it with another drink.
6081<>xx<>I ordered the Tropical Itch, suggested by the bartender who said it was a sweet drink.
6082<>xx<>Again, a sour drink.
6083<>xx<>Perhaps a mixer/juice was bad.
6084<>xx<>We ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Abalone Style Calamari.
6085<>xx<>The calamari was good, but a bit soft from improper frying.
6086<>xx<>The coconut shrimp rolls were outstanding.
6087<>xx<>We opted to skip the main course and go to dessert.
6088<>xx<>We ordered the Coconut Creme Pie.
6089<>xx<>The pie was not the custard type but more of a cheesecake.
6090<>xx<>After getting a large glob of cream cheese which I had to sneak from my mouth to my napkin, we gave up and asked for our check.
6091<>xx<>The 2 stars are 1 for the shrimp rolls and 1 for our waitress.
6092<>xx<>We are leaving here disappointed and in need of a Good drink and dinner.
6093<>xx<>This was a $40 lesson.
6094<>xx<>A friend of mine suggested we meet at Hula's for drinks and dinner and from the description it sounded great, I had just hoped it would hold up to everything she said and it totally did!
6095<>xx<>The atmosphere is great, staff is super friendly and made some great suggestions and the food was really good too.
6096<>xx<>The banana coconut cream pie is freaking amazing!
6097<>xx<>We will absolutely be back to this place and bring friends.
6098<>xx<>I stumbled across this place as it was close to my hotel.
6099<>xx<>I'm a creature of habit and will definitely be back.
6100<>xx<>The service was great!
6101<>xx<>I had the tuna burger and it was delicious.
6102<>xx<>The patio was open and the weather was perfect and like the name says it has a very cool modern feel.
6103<>xx<>They also have a nice selections of cocktails.
6104<>xx<>I would definitely recommend Hula's Modern Tiki.
6105<>xx<>This is a cool place for happy hour or dinner.
6106<>xx<>I feel like I'm on vacation when I eat here.
6107<>xx<>The coconut chicken was pretty good.
6108<>xx<>The drinks are strong which is great.
6109<>xx<>The servers are friendly.
6110<>xx<>Review for the $9.99 Groupon deal for five jello shots.
6111<>xx<>Not much to say really.
6112<>xx<>Groupon was easy to redeem.
6113<>xx<>No line around 10 PM.
6114<>xx<>Got the jello shots in grape and apple.. Wasn't really that good.
6115<>xx<>It's an ok place to go for a quick craving bite.
6116<>xx<>They can put pretty much anything you want on a hot dog.
6117<>xx<>I'd go back...once every now and then.
6118<>xx<>Mmm...I love hot dogs.
6119<>xx<>I especially love hot dogs with all sorts of awesome toppings, so Pink's was high on my to-do list in Vegas.
6120<>xx<>As a former hot dog sales gal, I like to think I know hot dogs pretty well, and this was a GOOD hot dog.
6121<>xx<>My friend and I made our way over here just as they opened at 10:30...yes, we're gross for eating hot dogs at 10:30, but whatever.
6122<>xx<>I wasn't sure what to order until I saw the "Mel B" dog, which had (if I remember correctly): nacho cheese, onions, sour cream, guac, hot peppers, and mustard?
6123<>xx<>All my favourite things...once again, Scary Spice saves the day!
6124<>xx<>The gal working at the counter was super smiley and friendly.
6125<>xx<>Our hot dogs only took a few minutes to make.
6126<>xx<>The bun is pretty small, but very soft and yummy.
6127<>xx<>The dog had that perfect "snap" to it when you bite in...mmm.
6128<>xx<>The dog itself was one of the best I've had, I think!
6129<>xx<>In terms of toppings...they REALLY load them on.
6130<>xx<>The onions were pretty big (same with the peppers), and there's tons of each thing, so there wound up being a kind of bad ration of toppings to hot dog.
6131<>xx<>I managed to eat it with my hands (no knife and fork), but barely.
6132<>xx<>Next time I'd get less on top.
6133<>xx<>Overall, though, it was really tasty and I will definitely go back next time I'm near a Pink's.
6134<>xx<>(Le Chien Chaud in Calgary is still my top dog, though!)
6135<>xx<>I went here for lunch the last day I was in Vegas.
6136<>xx<>I had the Las Vegas dog which was 2 hot dogs in the same bun with chili, mustard, onions, guacamole and jalapenos.
6137<>xx<>It was good, but I have had better.
6138<>xx<>I do have to give them a thumbs up for the selection of dogs they had considering it just a hot dog joint.
6139<>xx<>I make sure you only come here when the weather is nice.
6140<>xx<>They only have outdoor seating so you'll be really hot in the summer nad really cold in the winter.
6141<>xx<>Never been to the original Pink's in SoCal, but I couldn't imagine waiting 2 hours in line for this.
6142<>xx<>I mean it ain't no Costco dog and Portillo's it ain't.
6143<>xx<>I've been here a few times for a quick bite since I stay at PH often.
6144<>xx<>They've got a lot of unique dogs and hefty portions, but most of it is just covered in excessive toppings so I usually just stick to the naked dog or one w/ chili and jalapenos.
6145<>xx<>They just lack that snap that you look for when you bite into a good dog/sausage.
6146<>xx<>If you're on a hot dog quest in Vegas after some drinking this would definitely hit the spot, but otherwise go inside and grab a sandwich from the Earl.
6147<>xx<>The hot dogs there are good, not the greatest, but I like the different toppings and types of hot dogs they have.
6148<>xx<>This wouldn't be a place I have to go to every time I'm in Vegas, but would definitely go if I wanted something quick and easy.
6149<>xx<>The service was nice, quick, and friendly.
6150<>xx<>Unfortunately, it was really windy the day we went so we had to stand inside at a very small counter.
6151<>xx<>It's pretty small inside.
6152<>xx<>I wish there were more inside seating.
6153<>xx<>There is plenty of outside patio seating if the weather was nice enough.
6154<>xx<>We ordered: -Vegas Strip Dog -The Showgirl Dog -Mushroom Swiss Dog
6155<>xx<>I haven't been to the original in LA but the Las Vegas version at the Planet Hollywood Casino is a pretty good dog - overpriced of course but did you expect anything else?
6156<>xx<>The hot dogs are firm and have a nice casing and I honestly thought the chili was pretty good although definitely overloaded to the point of making the hot dog tough to eat.
6157<>xx<>Not health food but I would definitely go again if I was looking for a quick meal in the area.
6158<>xx<>Great hot dog!
6159<>xx<>Their reputation preceded them because I've heard about how famous Pink's is in Los Angeles and I was happy to see that there was one so close to the Bellagio.
6160<>xx<>I went with a friend of mind around noon.
6161<>xx<>Pinks is right in front of Planet Hollywood adjacent to the street.
6162<>xx<>The wait when we got there was only a few minutes but since it was 105 degrees, it was a little uncomfortable.
6163<>xx<>I ordered the bacon chili cheese dog, a drink, and the chili cheese fries.
6164<>xx<>The total came out to be just under $17 which is a little steep, but I guess it is to be expected in Las Vegas.
6165<>xx<>When the food came, I immediately thought, "how am I supposed to fit this in my mouth."
6166<>xx<>(insert that's what she said joke)   There was a normal sized hot dog underneath a mountain of bacon, tomatoes, onions, and chili.
6167<>xx<>I literally could not pick it up unless I risked having all the insides falling off of my plate.
6168<>xx<>I had to grab a knife and fork to tackle the foot long an inch at a time.
6169<>xx<>It tasted fantastic and i could feel my eyes getting heavier immediately from the food induced coma the meat from the chili was putting me in.
6170<>xx<>After I finished my hot dog filled with 3 slices of bacon goodness, I was very stuffed.
6171<>xx<>I'm usually one with a decent size appetite but the high fatty food filled me up quick.
6172<>xx<>...and then there were the chili cheese fries to deal with.
6173<>xx<>It looked as though the workers used a bucket to pour on the chili since there was so much of it and I knew immediately that I had to take it to go and offer it as communal fries.
6174<>xx<>The few bites I could squeeze into my already full stomach were delicious.
6175<>xx<>The texture and the size of the fries were crispy and thinner than traditional fries but it worked.
6176<>xx<>Its definitely worth a try and I would totally go to Pink's again.
6177<>xx<>I only ate at Pink's because I have heard so much about the one in LA.
6178<>xx<>It was better than most hot dogs, but not anything exceptional.
6179<>xx<>That could have been because I didn't have a special type of dog.
6180<>xx<>It was a great place for a quick bite before exploring the rest of the strip.
6181<>xx<>Probably one of the best hot dogs I've ever eaten.
6182<>xx<>I had the Las Vegas Strip Dog, Mushroom Swiss Dog and the Bacon Chili Dog.
6183<>xx<>The line was long, but went fast and the dogs were served quickly as well.
6184<>xx<>I'd recommend this place to all my friends when they go to Las Vegas.
6185<>xx<>No clue how this place stays open.
6186<>xx<>Food is WAAAAY overpriced, as are the driniks; service is horrid.
6187<>xx<>Four of us: we ordered 2 ceviches, 2 carnitas sopes, chips/queso and a total of 6 margaritas (at $10 a pop), our bill was $127.
6188<>xx<>$127?!
6189<>xx<>The carnitas sopes came two on a plate with black beans and rice.
6190<>xx<>The sopes had NO flavor to them.
6191<>xx<>Zip.
6192<>xx<>Zilch.
6193<>xx<>Nada.
6194<>xx<>They had to be covered in salsa and queso to even make it tolerable.
6195<>xx<>Our waitress was nice, she was new, but getting drinks took an act of Congress.
6196<>xx<>Once the margaritas came, we had to ask 3 times for water, that seemed to take the longest.
6197<>xx<>On a Thursday afternoon??
6198<>xx<>Really??
6199<>xx<>I think they were bringing it in by the bucketful from the Hoover Dam.
6200<>xx<>I've been to Cabo Wabo in Cabo and we enjoyed ourselves and the service; and even though I didn't think it was possible, this one in Vegas both sucked AND blew.
6201<>xx<>Came here for lunch.
6202<>xx<>Waited 20 min for a shaded outdoor table & got one half shaded.
6203<>xx<>Asked hostess for a more shaded table, she said i had to wait... um isnt that what i just did??
6204<>xx<>Came inside, waitress took over 10 min to greet us.
6205<>xx<>Drinks we ordered sat at the bar for over 5 so I got up to get them.
6206<>xx<>One corona was warm.
6207<>xx<>My crispy taco fell apart in the first bite, shrimp taco was super watery.
6208<>xx<>Bad experience, will not come back.
6209<>xx<>This place was great!
6210<>xx<>My boyfriend and I got free margaritas with the yelp check-in deal!
6211<>xx<>They don't offer chips and salsa before your meal which is weird for a Mexican restaurant, but the service and food were good, so I'd definitely be back.
6212<>xx<>Good food, great drinks.
6213<>xx<>I especially love walking in and seeing/hearing everything rock n roll around the place.
6214<>xx<>The couple of times I've been here there has been very good service and no complaints about the food or anything.
6215<>xx<>In fact, one time I went they were doing a special where you got a free frozen margarita (with Cabo Wabo tequila, the house favorite) with an entree order.
6216<>xx<>This was during the summer, so I'm not sure when it will be back, if at all.
6217<>xx<>I always order the Sopas con Carne (carnitas on corn cakes) and, when I'm feeling fancy, a margarita with Sammy Hagar's own Cabo Wabo tequila.
6218<>xx<>Really enjoyed the atmosphere.
6219<>xx<>Great food.
6220<>xx<>The service is a little slow but your in Vegas so take your time and enjoy..
6221<>xx<>sitting out on the patio on the vegas strip with a margarita and some nachos...little bit of heaven!
6222<>xx<>Nachos were big though...plenty to take back to the hotel for a midnight snack!
6223<>xx<>If I really had to, I guess I will come back to Cabo Wabo.
6224<>xx<>But given this is Vegas, Thank You because there are better places around.
6225<>xx<>To start off, we ask to be seated by the heater and where did we get seated... not near the heater.
6226<>xx<>Uhhh, did you not hear us?!
6227<>xx<>It was a cold Saturday night so when we saw open space by the heater, we decided to scoot our table ourselves.
6228<>xx<>I ordered the mushroom fajitas plate- I wouldn't recommend it.
6229<>xx<>Partly my fault because after ordering it I realized how delicious can mushroom fajitas be?!
6230<>xx<>And partly because the mushrooms were flavorless.
6231<>xx<>It was not marinated and grilled that well.
6232<>xx<>If I'm ever back, I'll head straight to the bar instead.
6233<>xx<>!
6234<>xx<>I give this place five stars it is delicious and the jalapeño margaritas are awesome their fajitas with chicken beef and shrimp off the hook....... there service was excellent I loved it beautiful view also of the strip....
6235<>xx<>I am vegan and love this spot!
6236<>xx<>We usually order a vegan burrito or vegan fajitas etc.
6237<>xx<>I just have to be clear about not having any cheese/cream/lard/chicken stock etc.
6238<>xx<>I am always disappointed with my drinks at other establishments because they rig the liquor, but I have never had an issue with my drinks at Cabo Wabo.
6239<>xx<>Nice outdoor patio overlooking the strip, great chips 'n salsa, and tasty drinks!
6240<>xx<>Yum!
6241<>xx<>Tip: We purchase 20% off coupons at the nearby kiosks for like $2 and usually get our photo taken while eating that comes with another 20% off coupon!
6242<>xx<>The reason I give it five stars is the terrific customer service this place has.
6243<>xx<>I went there with an offer from groupon.
6244<>xx<>When I gave the waitress the groupon, she happily took it and didn't even groan (groupon customers know well to hide their groupon till the check comes),  I wish I wrote her name down, but regardless, she was fantastic.
6245<>xx<>My friend had the quesadilla and I had the tacos al pastor,... both were extremely filling, good, and were all we ate all day.
6246<>xx<>They weren't the BEST, but not bad.
6247<>xx<>Because we had great service, we give this 5 stars.
6248<>xx<>I can't wait to go back!
6249<>xx<>We had lunch there and arrived at 11:30, we were seated in the back hallway.
6250<>xx<>It was a little weird, but judging by how many people were there it must be good eats!
6251<>xx<>I ordered a sample platter that is not on the menu and includes a cup of etoufee, gumbo and red beans and rice.
6252<>xx<>We also ordered sweet potato fries to start.
6253<>xx<>Fries arrived right away and lunch soon after.
6254<>xx<>We did not have to wait long.
6255<>xx<>EXCEPTIONAL!
6256<>xx<>My sample platter didn't look like much but it was a whole lot of food.
6257<>xx<>I could only eat about half and I can put food away.
6258<>xx<>Half way through lunch, it was standing room only for seating.
6259<>xx<>This little joint is amazing!
6260<>xx<>As long as it stays on point, we will be regulars!
6261<>xx<>Yummy food, cold brew, excellent service every time we've been.
6262<>xx<>We have tried nearly everything on the menu, have not had a bad meal...
6263<>xx<>This popular New Orleans inspired restaurant has been calling me for 3 years.
6264<>xx<>Finally I navigated into the Holsom shopping center for a taste.
6265<>xx<>Apparently everyone likes this place too as there was no immediate parking.
6266<>xx<>After 10 minutes of parking lot stalking I found a spot and went inside.
6267<>xx<>The dining room is small and jam packed with tables.
6268<>xx<>It actually reminded me of some of the places I sampled ages ago when I was in New Orleans.
6269<>xx<>The menu has po' boy sandwiches, gumbo, creole, remoulade, catfish and more NOLA favorites.
6270<>xx<>The restaurant has been featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives and the owner comes from New Orleans.
6271<>xx<>The wait staff was excellent.
6272<>xx<>Although they seemed like they were running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they all took time to ask how I was doing.
6273<>xx<>My waitress suggested the Bronzed Catfish and grits and I took the bait.
6274<>xx<>Due to the crowd, the wait for my meal was longer than I would have liked for lunch and I received several apologies from the waitress and the manager.
6275<>xx<>When the meal came, it was truly worth the wait.
6276<>xx<>The grits had absorbed the flavor of the well cooked catfish and the gouda/mushroom mixture.
6277<>xx<>The catfish was well seasoned with a light coating that didn't overpower the fish.
6278<>xx<>The bread was an afterthought and did not add anything to the meal but did assist in cleaning the last bites of grits off the plate.
6279<>xx<>I would have liked it to have more of a cajun kick and will definitely try a spicier option the next trip out.
6280<>xx<>I only have one New Orleans experience and it was in the early 90's so I am not an expert on New Orleans cuisine by any means but I can say I enjoyed Lolas and will return soon.
6281<>xx<>For lunch you can expect to pay between $9.00 for the least expensive Po'boy to $16.00 for the catfish and grits.
6282<>xx<>Definitely the place to eat when in Las Vegas.
6283<>xx<>Delicious Louisiana Cajun food with the perfect amount of flavor and heat.
6284<>xx<>Love it!
6285<>xx<>Just so everyone knows...I had high expectations for this place due to all of the reviews.
6286<>xx<>I was so EXCITED to go to this place after I looked at the menu it was RIDICULOUS.
6287<>xx<>From the beginning to end it was bad  1.When we walked in on a Wednesday as soon as they opened there were two people on the patio and two people inside.
6288<>xx<>It was a great day outside and we thought to sit outside first but our waitress WHISKED us inside so quickly we didn't get a second to make up our mind.We sat down to figure out that their air conditioning was on ARCTIC so I told her if we could go outside.
6289<>xx<>SHE LITERALLY ROLLED HER EYES...and said "IT'S A LITTLE WINDY, BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT THEN.." ummm ma'am take us outside please!
6290<>xx<>2.This was our first time there and my bf was having trouble deciding so we took a little longer to order.
6291<>xx<>Her coming EVERY 5 seconds didn't help.
6292<>xx<>If I were her, I would've maybe suggested an item on the menu or even ask if she could help in any way..NOPE.
6293<>xx<>3.I ordered the crawfish hush puppies to start and jambalaya with added shrimp.
6294<>xx<>My bf ordered the fried shrimp with the fried oyster, and crab cake.
6295<>xx<>He asked for gritz and greens on the side.
6296<>xx<>The crawfish puppies were interesting.I don't eat crawfish much so I'm not exactly sure how they supposed to taste so I'll just describe what it tasted like.Tart.The jambalaya came and LOOKED very promising.That jambalaya HURT MY FEELINGS.
6297<>xx<>It was the mushiest, no flavor having jambalaya I have EVER TASTED.
6298<>xx<>This jambalaya was the WORST ever.
6299<>xx<>It taste like tomato and mushy rice.
6300<>xx<>The chicken was very small and the shrimp just had no taste to it.
6301<>xx<>My bf's food was COOKED perfectly.His fish was crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside.
6302<>xx<>He took his first bite and said "It needs A LOT of hot sauce" I tasted that fish and AGAIN no flavor!
6303<>xx<>I mean..NONE I was soooooooo confused because Cajun food usually has SO MUCH FLAVOR..He used half their bottle of hot sauce to give that fish flavor.He taste the grits and actually sent them back because they were so bad.
6304<>xx<>Just so you know my bf isn't the type to send food back.
6305<>xx<>He rather just pour a lot of salt and pepper on it and "make it work" Needless to say, after that HORRIBLE meal and the $70 bill we were done.
6306<>xx<>On the car ride home, I was sad.
6307<>xx<>I kept saying 'I could've made some Zatarains jambalaya that was better than that"!!
6308<>xx<>*After I came out of my depression a couple of days later, I went to the OYSTER BAR in the PALACE STATION and ordered the jambalaya and my bf ordered the gumbo.
6309<>xx<>I PROMISE you the HEAVENS SANG!
6310<>xx<>I felt like I was born again.
6311<>xx<>That jambalaya was the ABSOLUTE BEST JAMBALAYA ever.
6312<>xx<>My bf became extremely quiet when we were eating and when I looked up...I SWEAR TO BABY JESUS he was chewing with his eyes closed nodding his head in pleasure!
6313<>xx<>If you want some cajun food..GO THERE!
6314<>xx<>amazing Jumbalaya
6315<>xx<>I had been dying to try Lola's and my friend's birthday was the perfect opportunity!
6316<>xx<>Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go all-out and try a ton of menu items.
6317<>xx<>We made a reservation for Saturday night and were greeted by Lola, herself, at the door.
6318<>xx<>The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall.
6319<>xx<>Here is the low-down on the meal:  Crab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious!
6320<>xx<>Lots of crab and not a lot of filler.
6321<>xx<>A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic.
6322<>xx<>The crab cakes were second only to my own.
6323<>xx<>Craw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive!
6324<>xx<>These were crispy and delicious, but maybe a touch too soft/undercooked in the middle.
6325<>xx<>Gumbo - The gumbo looked good and started off great on my palate, but lacked seasoning, mainly salt, and spice.
6326<>xx<>Catfish and grits - OMG the cheesy grits were unbelievable, I literally did not want to eat the last bite.
6327<>xx<>The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected.
6328<>xx<>They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up.
6329<>xx<>My dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread.
6330<>xx<>I was able to steal some french fries and was so glad I did, they were fantastic.
6331<>xx<>My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me.
6332<>xx<>Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.
6333<>xx<>Lola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.
6334<>xx<>Banana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste!
6335<>xx<>It was the best banana's foster I have ever had.
6336<>xx<>A delicious sweet brown sugar coating with the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream...yes please!
6337<>xx<>Overall, Lola's is a great Cajun alternative to the real deal.
6338<>xx<>There were definitely some high points to the meal, but there were a few mediocre points as well.
6339<>xx<>I wish they had live jazz, that would really create some true NOLA ambiance.
6340<>xx<>I will definitely be back to check out more of the menu and I am so glad we have a great Cajun restaurant in Las Vegas!
6341<>xx<>We came in at about 8pm and it was fairly busy but they got us seated quickly.
6342<>xx<>They sat us on the patio but it was in a weird spot behind one of the building pillars and 2 feet away from everyone walking in/out, which was kind of disappointing.
6343<>xx<>For whatever reason, it took over 10 minutes for someone to come over to us after we sat.
6344<>xx<>Two waitresses were walking around serving the other tables just next to us but didn't even take our drink order.
6345<>xx<>My wife doesn't eat seafood so she went with fettuccine alfredo with chicken ($14) and I got the shrimp and grits.
6346<>xx<>The fettuccine was really tasty, a lot more flavor than most pasta-focused places and the chicken was delicious.
6347<>xx<>It was slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside.
6348<>xx<>Her plate was a pretty large portion but the shrimp and grits seemed really small for $17.
6349<>xx<>Either way, it was killer!
6350<>xx<>The Ghouda grits are some of the best grits I've ever had...really creamy and taste amazing with the spiciness from the rest of the plate.
6351<>xx<>There are 5 decent size shrimp on top which were plump and juicy.
6352<>xx<>We also went with the bananas foster for dessert which was good but a little pricey at $8.
6353<>xx<>Overall, the food is really good and by itself easily deserves 4 stars...5 if it wasn't overpriced.
6354<>xx<>The service was nothing special but it could have just been a bad night.
6355<>xx<>We will come back, especially when crawfish seasons comes around again!
6356<>xx<>THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!
6357<>xx<>My mom and I were driving along Charleston Blvd when we came across this place.
6358<>xx<>This was my first attempt at Cajun Food - let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS!
6359<>xx<>I had the Blackened Catfish with Grits.
6360<>xx<>Never had Catfish nor Grits before, so needless to say, I was super apprehensive.
6361<>xx<>Coming from Hawaii where Spam is King, Catfish and Grits are not exactly on the menu everyday.
6362<>xx<>But, I was assured by the super nice Waiter that it's Lola's special and that I would not be disappointed.
6363<>xx<>When the dish came out, it was more than I could have expected!
6364<>xx<>The cajun spices were amazing - it has a spicy bite, but not to the point where you are dying for water.
6365<>xx<>It's the perfect combination to the flaky soft fish.
6366<>xx<>Combined with the grits and mushroom sauce...omg...it's a party in your mouth.
6367<>xx<>Fast forward to dessert, my mom has a sweet tooth so she had to have something.
6368<>xx<>But, she couldn't decide between the Bread Pudding and the Banana Fosters.
6369<>xx<>Lo and behold, Lola herself comes out and suggests the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding.
6370<>xx<>Apparently, a lot of other people were in the same predicament and so Lola combined the two desserts into one.
6371<>xx<>If you go here, you must try the Banana Fosters Bread Pudding.
6372<>xx<>Words will not do it justice, so I will not even try to attempt to express how amazing this dessert it.
6373<>xx<>Go there.
6374<>xx<>Try it.
6375<>xx<>I promise - you will not be disappointed.
6376<>xx<>Lola is the nicest lady ever - she came out from the Kitchen and greeted every single table.
6377<>xx<>When she stopped by our table, she greeted us like family and immediately made us feel like we've known her for years!
6378<>xx<>Bottom line, this place is a MUST GO when in Vegas.
6379<>xx<>Good Food, Good Service and Good People.
6380<>xx<>What more could you ask for?
6381<>xx<>Went here with my wife for dinner about three months ago.
6382<>xx<>The food was good, not great.
6383<>xx<>We shared the crawpuppies which were tasty but a little over-cooked.
6384<>xx<>My wife got the bronzed catfish and grits.
6385<>xx<>The grits were really good, but I didn't care for the catfish.
6386<>xx<>I had the jambalaya which was fine, though the rice was a little mushy.
6387<>xx<>I like it.
6388<>xx<>I think they have a bit of molecular gastronomy going on with the tuna raspberry skewer where the tuna and raspberry are both in a cube.
6389<>xx<>But of course they also wrote "molecular" next to the dish.
6390<>xx<>I had the steak sandwich with fries and a shot of tomato gazpacho and for $12 or so it was a pretty good deal.
6391<>xx<>I like Aria and seen this place many times, too bad it took me a few times until I tried it.
6392<>xx<>Anyway I'm definitely coming back here for dinner.
6393<>xx<>Came here on a recommendation of a client of mine who tends to be fairly particular (in a good way) about what she likes.
6394<>xx<>So I thought it has to at least be decent!
6395<>xx<>Right?
6396<>xx<>Well let me tell you I am Spanish...
6397<>xx<>I have lived in San Diego California since I was 9 and have NEVER found a tapas restaurant I cared for.
6398<>xx<>Eating the food at Julian Serrano took me back to my child hood.
6399<>xx<>The food was authentic with a modern twist!
6400<>xx<>So creative.. GREAT SERVICE!!
6401<>xx<>Will make this place a must go to for every Vegas visit!!
6402<>xx<>Would highly recommend trying a little bit of everything
6403<>xx<>I can' t say enough great things about this restaurant - everything is great about this spot.
6404<>xx<>Fantastic servers, great bartenders, terrific menu and high quality everything.
6405<>xx<>My first dinner / drink visit was so wonderful that I returned for a second meal there in under 24 hours.
6406<>xx<>I was craving their Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, risotto and brava potatoes too badly to stay away.
6407<>xx<>This is a classy place - it looks beautiful and will be sure to treat you and your pals incredibly well.
6408<>xx<>I'm looking forward to getting back there for another great meal and some bartender bonding (these guys know their stuff, super fun to sit at the bar with).
6409<>xx<>Julian Serrano for lunch was perfect.
6410<>xx<>It's in the beautiful Aria hotel and the decor is very chic.
6411<>xx<>The menu definitely has a Spanish flair--and the chef is very well acclaimed.
6412<>xx<>We had the lobster pineapple skewers for an app, and then i had the saffron rice for an entrée.
6413<>xx<>Although both were delicious, I don't think they were entirely memorable.
6414<>xx<>The saffron rice was a little too al dente for my taste--but the combination of flavors from the sausage, rabbit, and chicken made it worthwhile.
6415<>xx<>The prices were definitely affordable.
6416<>xx<>Ordered three plates: (1) yellowtail "tiradito" - very good (loved the fried string sweet potatoes with it.
6417<>xx<>The portion was very small (only three pieces), (2) white ceviche - decent, but had better, (3) Heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella ice cream- tasty.
6418<>xx<>Overall, the food is good, but portion is very small and it's pricey.
6419<>xx<>I know it's a tapas place, but I've had bigger portions at other tapas place.
6420<>xx<>As someone that was born and raised in Spain, my expectations of "Spanish" restaurants tend to be a bit higher than most.
6421<>xx<>When you sit down at a place like this, after not being able to taste the food from your country for months, or even years!
6422<>xx<>little key words stand out.
6423<>xx<>And those words make you very excited.
6424<>xx<>For me, the key words were HAM, CABRALES, TORTILLA and PIMIENTO.
6425<>xx<>The fact that I saw all of these key words on the menu was a good sign.
6426<>xx<>Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.
6427<>xx<>My fiance and I were hungry and excited to eat some spanish food so we ordered a bunch of different things.
6428<>xx<>We started off with the Jamon Serrano and Spanish Charcuterie.
6429<>xx<>The Jamon was on top of some tomato garlic sauce.
6430<>xx<>It was about as bland as they come.
6431<>xx<>And I mean bland.
6432<>xx<>They served it on top of some garlic tomato sauce which to me, all it does is mask the flavor of the ham.
6433<>xx<>I was really disappointed.
6434<>xx<>The Charcuterie was also as bland as the ham.
6435<>xx<>The lomo in that plate had absolutely no flavor.
6436<>xx<>Where are they getting their products from?
6437<>xx<>Then we got the cheese platter!
6438<>xx<>another key word, CABRALES!
6439<>xx<>I am from Asturias, that is where Cabrales cheese comes from.
6440<>xx<>And I can say this much.
6441<>xx<>That was NOT it.
6442<>xx<>It is a very stinky, spicy blue cheese and what they served us was a creamy bland mess they called cabrales.
6443<>xx<>The tortilla....... sucked.
6444<>xx<>Sorry, it sucked.
6445<>xx<>It was so dry.....
6446<>xx<>I almost finished my whole glass of wine with it.
6447<>xx<>That is NOT how tortilla is supposed to be!
6448<>xx<>For one because it sucks with onions in it.
6449<>xx<>It completely overpowers the flavor of the potatoes and egg.
6450<>xx<>But it was so overcooked.....
6451<>xx<>I come from a family that makes spanish tortilla on a daily basis.
6452<>xx<>I make it, my mom makes it, my grandma makes it.... and they all turn out glorious.
6453<>xx<>Why is this one so..... meh?
6454<>xx<>Onto the next...... the Octopus.
6455<>xx<>It was surprisingly good!
6456<>xx<>Nothing bad to say on this one.
6457<>xx<>The Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were delicious.
6458<>xx<>It gave me a few good ideas to make at home since I have them in my fridge.
6459<>xx<>and lastly  The Stuffed Dates.
6460<>xx<>They were very delicious.
6461<>xx<>I don't know how spanish this dish is, because I actually never had it in Spain before, but they were fantastic.
6462<>xx<>Overall the restaurant is nice, the atmosphere is trendy and it had a good vibe.
6463<>xx<>I'm sure for someone who isn't used to this type of food, the food will be great.
6464<>xx<>But I did not like it.
6465<>xx<>As a matter of fact, I get upset when the waiter tells me the chef is from Madrid and then they serve me that.
6466<>xx<>Is he really from Madrid?
6467<>xx<>Has he even been there?
6468<>xx<>Does he know what the food looks like there?
6469<>xx<>I'm confused
6470<>xx<>Fun lil tappas place.
6471<>xx<>Good atmosphere.
6472<>xx<>Different areas for intimate dining, group dining or entertaining view from the bar.
6473<>xx<>Server was informative without being pushy.
6474<>xx<>Portions fill you up just enough.
6475<>xx<>My friend and I shared potatoes bravas, chicken croquetas, and creamy risotto.
6476<>xx<>The food was  delicious, but on the expensive side for tapas.
6477<>xx<>I know it's Vegas and that's expected.
6478<>xx<>We also shared the red sangria pitcher which was pretty big for the value.
6479<>xx<>Would definitely come back.
6480<>xx<>Julian Serrano is located just inside the casino entrance to Aria resort at The City Center on the Vegas Strip.
6481<>xx<>It is an upscale fine dining restaurant that features Spanish tapas (or sharing plates).
6482<>xx<>Simone and I arrived in our finest t-shirts, shorts and sneakers.
6483<>xx<>Although not exactly dressed for a formal dinner, I let the hostess know I had made a reservation and we were quickly escorted past the rich and almost famous to the corner table at the far end of the dining room.
6484<>xx<>Reservations are an absolute necessity if you plan to get a table at this restaurant (especially when dressed like a tourist from Maine).After being seated, our very formal waiter quickly offered us a very expensive wine menu and so we decided to get a diet soda and water ( from the tap).
6485<>xx<>We looked over the menu and decided that we wanted to try the Paella as our entree that we would share.
6486<>xx<>The Paella takes at least 35 minutes to prepare so we placed our order before deciding on our smaller tapas plates.
6487<>xx<>First up we decided on a plate of marinated olives.
6488<>xx<>When they arrived we realized that they were not pitted, so we had fun seeing who could make the biggest mess while trying to get the pits out.
6489<>xx<>The waiter seemed amused by this.
6490<>xx<>The olives were very good and were marinated in roasted garlic and baby onions.
6491<>xx<>For our second tapas we decided to get more adventurous and ordered the Albondigas, which were mini Meatballs cooked in a Tomato and Sherry Sauce.
6492<>xx<>They were some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten and they just melted in the mouth.
6493<>xx<>The sauce was mild and light with a nice hint of sherry and also included some roasted baby potatoes.
6494<>xx<>Our last tapas choice was the new age Egg Potato & Morcilla dish.
6495<>xx<>The dish was a combination of sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Blood Sausage with a soft poached egg, atop a pool of Potato Foam topped with Manchego Cheese Air.
6496<>xx<>This dish was truly memorable and one of the most unique things I have ever eaten.
6497<>xx<>The richness of the sausage and egg combined magicaly with the smokey earthiness of the mushrooms and the potato foam and Manchego air melted away to create a creamy sauce for it all.
6498<>xx<>This dish was a real culinary adventure.
6499<>xx<>Our Valencia Paella was ready and came to the table piping hot and served in the cast iron pan it was cooked in.
6500<>xx<>It was a delicious combination of baked Saffron laced Spanish rice with house made Chorizo sausage, sauteed Rabbit and tender grilled Chicken topped of with roasted Haricot Verde Green Beans.
6501<>xx<>We managed to finish off the rather large Paella meal, and then wrapped things up with a dessert tapas of Almond Sponge Cake with Homemade Almond Ice Cream.
6502<>xx<>It was super dense, super moist and super good.
6503<>xx<>Our entire meal and experience at Julian Serrano was one that I will not soon forget.
6504<>xx<>It was creative, unique and prepared perfectly.
6505<>xx<>I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind shelling out a few extra bucks to have the perfect culinary adventure.
6506<>xx<>And next time I'll even wear pants...maybe.
6507<>xx<>I ate here on a slow Thursday evening with my girlfriend.
6508<>xx<>The restaurant has a beautiful and elegant interior, but it's open to one of the main Aria throughways, and that makes it feel kind of casual, like a swanky airport lounge.
6509<>xx<>We were seated right away, but at a table next to a serving station, so we had waiters loitering by us most of the time.
6510<>xx<>I hate that.
6511<>xx<>Our drinks, an Estrella and a white sangria, came right away.
6512<>xx<>Once we ordered, the plates came out in rapid succession.
6513<>xx<>I highly recommend the potatoes brava, tuna tiradito, spanish charcuterie platter and sautéed spinach.
6514<>xx<>I do not recommend the lobster croquetas (off-menu) or coca chorizo.
6515<>xx<>I also had a mixed bag of mixed olives.
6516<>xx<>We skipped dessert, opting instead to stroll over to Jean Philippe.
6517<>xx<>I can never fill up on tapas for some reason, but I left satisfied, and it was a good way to start the vacation.
6518<>xx<>(My 400th review...Woot, woot!)
6519<>xx<>During our most recent adventure to Vegas, we were in search for another great sandwich place and we ended going to Baguette Cafe.
6520<>xx<>Yeah, it was a little out of the way from the Strip, not to mention, it's located deep inside a business park.
6521<>xx<>Thankfully, I noticed the sign on their building while on the 215 so it wasn't that hard to figure out.
6522<>xx<>We got there around 11am on Tuesday and it was empty, we figured we'd beat the lunch rush.
6523<>xx<>The gentleman who helped us, we didn't get his name but I'm assuming he's the infamous Olivier, was quite hospitable.
6524<>xx<>He asked if we've been there before, offered suggestions and went through all the menu items we were curious about.
6525<>xx<>In the end, I ordered the Blue Brie Panini and the s/o ordered the Chipotle Chicken Panini.
6526<>xx<>With one bottled soda and one Iced Tea it all came out to just under $20.
6527<>xx<>I noticed they had Illy Coffee too, which is awesome but it was too warm to drink coffee.
6528<>xx<>:)  It took awhile for our sandwiches to be made, not sure why.
6529<>xx<>However, I did notice that their phone kept ringing and Olivier would give each caller the undivided attention that he provided us.
6530<>xx<>Yeah, that's awesome but at the same time, customers were starting to line up and wait.
6531<>xx<>When our sandwiches came out, the presentation was nice.
6532<>xx<>It came with a couple leaves of greens, the s/o said it was a salad because it had dressing, but IMO, it was a garnish but wow, it was tasty.
6533<>xx<>It would've been nice to have larger portion.
6534<>xx<>The s/o and I split our sandwiches to experience both.
6535<>xx<>My Blue Brie was pretty awesome!
6536<>xx<>The turkey was poached so, it's not your cold cut turkey, so it tasted quite fresh.
6537<>xx<>It also had apples and walnuts.
6538<>xx<>I absolutely loved it!
6539<>xx<>The Chipotle Chicken was good, just a little too spicy for me, hence "Chipotle" but who can hate on a sandwich with bacon in it?
6540<>xx<>The bread however is totally what made both Paninis, it rocked!
6541<>xx<>They baguette was freshly baked and served warm, yum!
6542<>xx<>Eat your heart our Subway and your "Eat Fresh" slogan, this is the real deal!
6543<>xx<>Overall, Baguette Cafe is a cute little place that I would love to visit again, maybe on the way to Red Rock.
6544<>xx<>I'll just have to remember that they're only open Mon-Fri.  At least now I can say I've been to a TRUE French cafe, outside of Paris...casino included!
6545<>xx<>Only my second time here, and a long time coming...but Oliver made it worth the wait...
6546<>xx<>I have been raving about this place for some time, but don't manage to get out to these parts often.
6547<>xx<>I am sure everyone would agree a relocation can be bitter sweet considering that the current location does cater to the medical and business district surrounding the area..  Those of us that don't frequent this area suffer while the nearby patrons prosper, although, Oliver makes it worth the drive as well.
6548<>xx<>If a relocation is in the future, I pray that it's not an expansion unless they can duplicate it enhance the service, otherwise, it's hard to replace the experience.
6549<>xx<>We stopped in after picking up my fiance's pops from the airport.
6550<>xx<>Breakfast was on order and we all had a day off what better time to sample over of the great breakfast joints Vegas has to offer.
6551<>xx<>Our walk from the parking lot included a warm greeting from the maintenance workers outside, uncommon but awesome.
6552<>xx<>We were then greeted inside and conversed with Oliver again, who provided a passionate overview of the days special offerings.
6553<>xx<>Everything looks up for the day ahead.
6554<>xx<>My fiance offered the chicken brie, my pops in law, the breakfast pannini, and myself, the fresh made quiche.
6555<>xx<>I don't know about everyone else's dish, but the quiche was the best I had.
6556<>xx<>It was most and flavorful with a good balance of ingredients.
6557<>xx<>The slice is hefty and a perfect portion to hold me down till lunch rolls around.
6558<>xx<>I did get to sample the fresh made chocolate truffle croissant twist as well and it was euphoric, considering I'm not much of a sweet tooth.
6559<>xx<>The ambiance is very welcoming and noticed new decorative art that added a nice touch.
6560<>xx<>The over sized glossed photography art adorned the walls, but a fee more were needed towards the rear of the eating area.
6561<>xx<>I believe the art resembled modern French stills.
6562<>xx<>I dug it and it reminds me of the art in the original Bachi Burger, also priced for gallery sale.
6563<>xx<>Staff always make you feel at home and when the weather permits, the outside patio provides a refreshing experience.
6564<>xx<>Don't forget about the coffee selection.
6565<>xx<>Illy can be a little overwhelming for my taste, since I'm a black coffee person, but think will more than satisfy other coffee aficionados.
6566<>xx<>I would give this experience an overall 4.5, minus 0.5 for the location, but round it up and what do you get??
6567<>xx<>A five-star experience and coming from me, that's really saying something.
6568<>xx<>Olivier makes my experience so welcoming.
6569<>xx<>Great food, service, environment.
6570<>xx<>They do a terrific job catering too.
6571<>xx<>Best Sandwich I have had since moving to Vegas!
6572<>xx<>Everything I order is always delish.
6573<>xx<>Just wish I could get the chocolate tart every time I go!
6574<>xx<>I get there later in the day and it's all sold out.
6575<>xx<>:-)
6576<>xx<>This place is worth traveling to.
6577<>xx<>The food and service is awesome.
6578<>xx<>Everything I had the quiche, cinnamon golden raisin croissant, and coffee were absolutely wonderful.
6579<>xx<>This little cafe is is in an business complex but as mentioned in other reviews worth the hunt.
6580<>xx<>The pricing is good and certainly worth any wait.
6581<>xx<>It really takes me back to France and makes me reminisce.
6582<>xx<>I only wish there were more places like this in Vegas, but I'm happy to have at least one cafe that is seriously knowledgeable on how to make great food.
6583<>xx<>Olivier and this family which own the cafe are absolutely wonderful.
6584<>xx<>Again, I'm adding on to the rave.
6585<>xx<>I've frequented the Baguette Cafe quite a number of times, and every time, I leave very satisfied.
6586<>xx<>The place, at first was difficult to find, is nestled among the silver office buildings right off Durango and 215.
6587<>xx<>Really casual place.
6588<>xx<>Reminiscent of Panera Bread.
6589<>xx<>It gets really busy for lunch, so prepare to wait, sit outside, or take something to-go to avoid upset; turnover is pretty quick, however, so you shouldn't wait too long to get a table.
6590<>xx<>The chipotle chicken sandwich, caprese salad, and soups are my favorite lunches to order there.
6591<>xx<>I am also in love with their tarts!!!
6592<>xx<>Along with an espresso, I could eat them everyday.
6593<>xx<>The owners are super sweet and personable.
6594<>xx<>I only wish they had a bigger, more central location!
6595<>xx<>Been coming here since it opened, I worked in the building across the way.
6596<>xx<>I've had pretty much every pastry and they were and are always excellent!
6597<>xx<>pineapple, apple, chocolate with coconut muffins were all great...made from scratch that same day...everytime!
6598<>xx<>Also love their soups and sandwhiches.
6599<>xx<>Particularly the three cheese with chicken...fresh slices of cheese, chicken breast on a grilled panini.
6600<>xx<>The raisin bread is the best i've ever had.
6601<>xx<>Staff is always friendly and place is always clean!
6602<>xx<>Came for lunch after Hot Pilates.
6603<>xx<>We were impressed with the authentic French food.
6604<>xx<>Portion sizes were fair, nice mild flavors indicative of French food.
6605<>xx<>Mama likes!!!
6606<>xx<>Please check all the other positive reviews before caving in on the "2" negatives (which seem like one hater and one friend of the competition)  Honestly, you give 1 star if food sucks, service sucks, the place was trashy and so forth.
6607<>xx<>Give this place a try, most of us LOVE it.
6608<>xx<>And I am sure real Yelpers would never try to ruin business for a company because we didn't have our butts kissed then massaged while being comped a meal!
6609<>xx<>The real Yelpers have spoken, and it appears Baguette Cafe IS a winner.
6610<>xx<>Oliver, can I get a free torte for this review?
6611<>xx<>;-)
6612<>xx<>Stopped in for lunch.
6613<>xx<>Ordered the tuna sandwich and a cup of coffee.
6614<>xx<>Sandwich was delicious.
6615<>xx<>Good coffee.
6616<>xx<>Great customer service.
6617<>xx<>Walked down from my hotel to this Fashion Square area restaurant.
6618<>xx<>As always, on that quest to find interesting places to eat when traveling.
6619<>xx<>I would say that the Culinary Dropout was both interesting and had pretty good food to boot.
6620<>xx<>The place has a young feel to it and the servers and bartenders could just be the most attractive (and I'm talkin' men and women here folks) collection I've ever seen working in one restaurant.
6621<>xx<>I grabbed a seat at the bar ordered a drink and decided on a Caesar Salad to start followed by Rainbow Trout for dinner.
6622<>xx<>The salad came in a chilled bowl, had both romaine and kale in it and a more lemony than garlicky dressing that had a nice tart bite to it.
6623<>xx<>The addition of kale was good and allowed me to text home and tell my wife I was eating a superfood for dinner to try and score some health points!
6624<>xx<>The trout came in a hurry, too much of one really, and was a large double filet with crisp skin, toasted almonds, green beans and some carmelized onions.
6625<>xx<>It was moist and tasty though it was somewhat unevenly salted.
6626<>xx<>The green beans on it were cooked just right and added a great crunch.
6627<>xx<>Beyond the pacing problems with the salad and entree coming out on top of each other, this was a nice meal and I would not hesitate to try it again.
6628<>xx<>The pretzel fondue is my favorite thing.
6629<>xx<>Also the fried chicken was pretty good
6630<>xx<>Went with another couple on a weeknight... no wait, good service.
6631<>xx<>The Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue is to die for.
6632<>xx<>We also ordered the Pork Belly Cubano, it was just eh, but the Kurobuta Pork Ribs were awsome!!!
6633<>xx<>They have a great beer/wine menu.
6634<>xx<>Would recommend this place more for drinks and apps.
6635<>xx<>but will definately head back.
6636<>xx<>Recently had dinner at the Culinary Dropout and was very impressed.
6637<>xx<>The ambiance just takes you to a different place and the menu is wonderful and varied.
6638<>xx<>I had the french onion soup and beef stroganoff.
6639<>xx<>Both very tasty although the onion soup was a little sweet for my palette.
6640<>xx<>We decided to follow up the meal with the carmel corn and wow, what a treat.
6641<>xx<>This is a fun restaurant and the food is good.
6642<>xx<>A great night out.
6643<>xx<>We attended the 4-course beer pairing and I highly recommend it.
6644<>xx<>The service was amazing and fast.
6645<>xx<>The pairing experience lasted about 2 hours and you are seating with other diners at a table that seats 16 people so you have an opportunity to really interact with the other diners which for us made the experience more fun.
6646<>xx<>If you are not a social butterfly this type of dining experience may not be for you.
6647<>xx<>During the pairing the beer representative made his rounds explaining what we were drinking and the history behind the beer and how it is made.
6648<>xx<>The chef also made his rounds after each course was served to give us the ingredients and techniques used.
6649<>xx<>Overall a great experience, plenty of service and we didn't have to do anything.
6650<>xx<>The only things that could have been a little different was the lighting was very dim so reading about our experience or reviewing the catalogs that were on the table was difficult and it was at times difficult to hear what was being said over the restaurant and other patron noise.
6651<>xx<>After reading about this place online and seeing the menu I had to give this place a try.
6652<>xx<>Perfect for the after work spot since it is walking distance.
6653<>xx<>The decor is nice and the leather seating in the booths are comforting and the fresh smell of leather is inviting to relax and enjoy the experience.
6654<>xx<>The staff is nice and attentive.
6655<>xx<>I ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich which delivered a great mix of savory flavors that welcomed me with each bite.
6656<>xx<>The fresh cut fries were crispy and soft which complimented the sandwich as if they were married in heaven.
6657<>xx<>Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their food as much as I did.
6658<>xx<>Some of the menu Items are priced reasonably but there are some that tip the charts.
6659<>xx<>All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work.
6660<>xx<>Trendy, hip, good looking staff, nice outdoor seating option, clean.
6661<>xx<>Great place to grab a bite with colleagues.
6662<>xx<>Great people watching and the food is really enjoyable.
6663<>xx<>Definitely get the pretzels and fondue and the dessert with Carmel popcorn is another must have.
6664<>xx<>Fox restaurants are consistently very good.
6665<>xx<>Pricing is ok and not obnoxiously expensive especially for being located at Scottsdale fashion square mall.
6666<>xx<>This is a great restaurant across from the Fashion Square Mall in Scottsdale Riverfront.
6667<>xx<>The overall ambiance and setting is more than warm and welcoming.
6668<>xx<>I loved the industrial look with huge chandeliers and high loft ceilings.
6669<>xx<>Kind of loud but energetic and fun.
6670<>xx<>We sat at the bar since we wanted to take advantage of happy hour (Happy hour is only offered at the bar area).
6671<>xx<>They offer Happy hour MON-FRI from 3 to 6 pm.
6672<>xx<>Food was good and cocktails (Great Moscow Mules and Moonshine Apple pie flavor shots) were even better.
6673<>xx<>Our Bartender was super friendly and took care of us greatly.
6674<>xx<>The pretzels with warm fondue were to die for!!!
6675<>xx<>MUST TRY....Huge portion and meant to be shared :-) I also tried the smoked salmon bruschetta, It was just okay nothing too special about it I also had the Seared ahi tuna salad, it was yummy with a perfect amount of ginger dressing and wasabi peas without over powering the salad.
6676<>xx<>Next time I am in Scottsdale I will be back for more.
6677<>xx<>First impressions last the longest.
6678<>xx<>This was our first time there.
6679<>xx<>We were impressed with the atmosphere...very "hip" (and loud) indeed.
6680<>xx<>Our server came to our table...he could have been a homeless person for all we knew...bearded out, tattooed, gadged earrings, and a nose ring that told us he was a rebel and perhaps did some prison time?
6681<>xx<>Rad.
6682<>xx<>He took our drink orders.
6683<>xx<>Came back with our drinks and my date and I asked for straws...came back with un-covered straws.
6684<>xx<>What I mean by that is he came back with straws that were open to the elements.
6685<>xx<>Whatever.
6686<>xx<>I put my straw in and took my first sip of Water and to my dismay, tasted something sweet on my straw.
6687<>xx<>It appeared that something was on my straw!
6688<>xx<>Was it our servers sticky fingers?
6689<>xx<>I wasn't thirsty anymore.
6690<>xx<>Diner's beware, ask for a straw with caution.
6691<>xx<>Drink responsibly.
6692<>xx<>We ordered the pretzel fondue for starters.
6693<>xx<>Very good.
6694<>xx<>(Thanks Yelpers)  Asked the server for suggestions as to what was good there and he basically read the menu...thanks man....not helpful but thanks anyway.
6695<>xx<>It was then that I decided that it was my goal to see if I could make him smile or show some sort of human emotion  (I failed...).
6696<>xx<>He was a bit of a harda$$.
6697<>xx<>Hard to crack but he was "hip"...fitting place for him to work.
6698<>xx<>I ordered the ribs.
6699<>xx<>"36hrs" of something enticed me to get them.
6700<>xx<>Meh.
6701<>xx<>They were boiled and had a decent sauce in them.
6702<>xx<>Nothing special.
6703<>xx<>My date got the fried chicken.
6704<>xx<>She offered a bite, I took a bite and grease poured out.
6705<>xx<>Nasty.
6706<>xx<>That just tells me the oil used hasn't been changed for a while.
6707<>xx<>Mmmm...tasty.
6708<>xx<>Overall, great place to drink and people watch.
6709<>xx<>The Scottsdale crowd is great to entertain us people watchers.
6710<>xx<>Food and straws are funky.
6711<>xx<>For that I give them two stars.
6712<>xx<>Maybe that's why their called "culinary dropout".
6713<>xx<>I have a very small list of absolute favorite places to go... and Culinary Dropout has made the list.
6714<>xx<>I was reading a tagline by another user right before I started this and it said that a restaurant is only as good as its worst dish.
6715<>xx<>If there is a bad dish at CD, I have not found it.
6716<>xx<>Before dinner I enjoyed one of their signature drinks called Velvet Death.
6717<>xx<>If you want a really fun evening, be sure to have a couple of those and secure a cab ride ahead of time.
6718<>xx<>Velvet Death is as smooth as its name... it is like slipping into a warm bath.
6719<>xx<>It is cool, it is refreshing, it has a great citrus flavor to it and the absinthe in it, doesnt hurt either.
6720<>xx<>I also enjoyed the pretzel fondue which was a recommendation from the waiter... yeah....
6721<>xx<>I would suggest you give that a go, but I am sure you will find other amazing appetizers as well.
6722<>xx<>We got to CD early for dinner... this is critical on two fronts, first, we could easily get a table and second I could order the Korean spiced Rib-eye cap, which is limited in daily availability.
6723<>xx<>If you can get it, do, it is most certainly worth having... actually, I dont think I have ever had a better cut of meat.
6724<>xx<>The service is terrific and the atmosphere is definitely a lot of fun.
6725<>xx<>Our waiter was always spot on on his recommendations and very attentive.
6726<>xx<>Sadly there is a bit of a downside to this place:  It is in the heart of Scottsdale and the clientele in the restaurant was on the whole the very stereotypical self-centered, pompous, rude, snobbery that after growing up in Scottsdale I used to claim was false... having lived outside of the bubble for a while I can tell you that the crowd is overall pretty disgusting.
6727<>xx<>The herd of 20k millionaires and other nefarious customers does tend to make the atmosphere a bit loud because these people do want everyone else to know just how "amazing" they are and how "wonderful" their life is.
6728<>xx<>Culinary Dropout of course can not do anything about the people who choose to come and enjoy their fare, but be prepared for it... is is a cultural experience in its own.
6729<>xx<>Have a few drinks of Velvet Death and you may even find it a bit amusing.
6730<>xx<>Incredible.
6731<>xx<>The salsa bar is amazing!
6732<>xx<>Good "upscale" mexican fast food, if that makes any sense.
6733<>xx<>Lots of great flavors to be had.
6734<>xx<>Mixing and matching with the unique salsas (peanut, pecan, cilantro and jicama salsas are standouts) allows for some pretty awesome flavor combinations.
6735<>xx<>Sort of an odd place, because it the menu feels like it should be a takeout or order-and-take your seat kind of place, but it has a beautiful wood bar that seems wasted on the environment.
6736<>xx<>If they do carry beer, it isn't in an obvious place (no taps, no display refridgerator).
6737<>xx<>And they appear to only carry one type of wine.
6738<>xx<>Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy...
6739<>xx<>Oh, I dream about the salsas here...
6740<>xx<>I love all the different combinations, and could very easily make a meal with those alone.
6741<>xx<>Love the tacos and the horchata as well.
6742<>xx<>My dad & I were in town for the day.
6743<>xx<>We were sooo hungry & in the mood for anything so yelp helped me find this place & of course we were kind of iffy about it & expected it to be like every other Mexican restaurant, BUT we were totally mistaken!
6744<>xx<>My dad is from Mexico City, but has been living in the US for almost 22 years.
6745<>xx<>This is the FIRST place ever to actually have tacos that tasted just like from his hometown!
6746<>xx<>He even teared up because of the memories that filled him (no i'm not exaggerating!
6747<>xx<>), & when my dad says the tacos are authentic then they are!
6748<>xx<>This place will be the only reason why we will come back to Phoenix!
6749<>xx<>Hopefully this place lives on for good!
6750<>xx<>:)
6751<>xx<>I've been here about 4 times now.
6752<>xx<>I love this place.
6753<>xx<>The name has changed, they've been serving alcohol for a while now, there's a new location in Glendale (I need to go), and the menu has expanded but isn't quite represented online yet.
6754<>xx<>Even the physical menus can be different.
6755<>xx<>The one I had had a few more items on it than my friends'.
6756<>xx<>The horchata is still the best I've ever had.
6757<>xx<>The margaritas are so freaking good.
6758<>xx<>I tried the marlin taco that wasn't there last time I visited.
6759<>xx<>I love trying things I've never had before.
6760<>xx<>Marlin is an odd fish.
6761<>xx<>Their preparation makes it look and taste almost like pork.
6762<>xx<>It's just... different.
6763<>xx<>Still good though!
6764<>xx<>My friend got the veggie burro.
6765<>xx<>She said it was pretty tasty, but a little on the bland side.
6766<>xx<>We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times.
6767<>xx<>She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.
6768<>xx<>They get slammed on weekends.
6769<>xx<>I was here at 7pm on a Friday.
6770<>xx<>They need more than 2 people serving and clearing on weekends.
6771<>xx<>When every table is packed there's almost no room to move.
6772<>xx<>Getting to the salsa bar can be pretty awkward.
6773<>xx<>Had a Groupon - went there today...
6774<>xx<>It was fantastic!
6775<>xx<>I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco plate.
6776<>xx<>Loved it!
6777<>xx<>I normally don't order rice and beans but since It was my first time visiting here, I did get them.
6778<>xx<>The beans had a nice flavor and they were moist enough to dip my chips in and eat that way.
6779<>xx<>The rice had bits of corn and cilantro and was very flavorful.
6780<>xx<>The salsa bar was also delicious with several options to choose from, including a strawberry salsa that was very nice for the sweltering Phoenix summer day.
6781<>xx<>I liked La Condesa so much, I bought another Groupon while eating my lunch!
6782<>xx<>:)
6783<>xx<>If you're a fan of big fancy, red carpet joints, this is not the place for you.
6784<>xx<>The service is not good, it is understaffed, the restaurant itself is small and there are a boat load of people there.
6785<>xx<>If you like eating some kick ass Mexican food though, this place tops the list.
6786<>xx<>I had the pork and bean burrito with a side of their chipotle salsa.
6787<>xx<>The meat was so tender and the flavor was so developed, I wept a little with each bite.
6788<>xx<>This is on my radar for the next time I come out to Phoenix.
6789<>xx<>Just hope they find a bigger location or open a taco truck.
6790<>xx<>YUM YUM YUM!!!
6791<>xx<>This place is amazing.
6792<>xx<>The focus is fresh delicious food.
6793<>xx<>Everything tastes like it was made from scratch that day.
6794<>xx<>Everything we've eaten had a distinct flavor so you can really get a feel for lots of different tastes.
6795<>xx<>Whatever kind of "Mexican" you are in the mood for; this place will deliver.
6796<>xx<>Nothing here ever feels like it was rushed to be cooked faster.
6797<>xx<>My fiancé and I have been here twice and the second time was even better than the first.
6798<>xx<>The first time we had 2 Cochinita pibil (pork) tacos, a Dogfish Shark taco and a Carne Asada taco.
6799<>xx<>All of them were amazing with each having their own unique seasonings, complimentary accoutrement (pickled red onion for the pork, cabbage and creamy salsa for the shark etc.).
6800<>xx<>The second time we got a 'Dogfish Shark' taco, a chicken mole taco and a chicken burrito.
6801<>xx<>The chicken mole was outstanding.
6802<>xx<>My mouth is watering remembering it.
6803<>xx<>It was a perfect earthy balance of the chili and the chocolate dancing on my tongue.
6804<>xx<>The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity.
6805<>xx<>The refried beans are smoky and smooth in an indescribable way.
6806<>xx<>The chicken was slow cooked and complimented the beans well.
6807<>xx<>The horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places.
6808<>xx<>My only complaint (because nothing's perfect right?)
6809<>xx<>is I would have liked more ice.
6810<>xx<>Yeah- that's all I could come up with.
6811<>xx<>The variety of salsas makes it fun.
6812<>xx<>The first time we went they didn't have the strawberry salsa we had read so much about, so of course we had to come back!
6813<>xx<>We got the strawberry salsa and there was also the peanut salsa which I preferred to the strawberry one.
6814<>xx<>Again the variety of tastes in the salsa is fantastic.
6815<>xx<>The flavor combinations are unique and widely varied from sweet, to savory to spicy.
6816<>xx<>I work around the corner so will definitely be back for more!
6817<>xx<>Great shark taco, mole quesadilla, salsa bar with peanut and pecan salsas, decor, and best goddamn horchata I've ever had.
6818<>xx<>Thanks for the find, yelp!
6819<>xx<>My profound love of Mexican cuisine and a bevy of shining Yelp reviews of this place led me here last Saturday night.
6820<>xx<>My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!
6821<>xx<>The salsa bar is fantastic!
6822<>xx<>Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me.....
6823<>xx<>But really they were all good.
6824<>xx<>The very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?)
6825<>xx<>It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible.
6826<>xx<>All the taco's we had were great though.
6827<>xx<>To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them.
6828<>xx<>I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.
6829<>xx<>Lastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split.
6830<>xx<>Holy crap- it was a monster!
6831<>xx<>They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them!
6832<>xx<>Humongous!
6833<>xx<>It resembled a strudel pastry!
6834<>xx<>Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe?
6835<>xx<>I dunno, but it was to die for!
6836<>xx<>Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic!
6837<>xx<>The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day!
6838<>xx<>(Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)!
6839<>xx<>All in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back.
6840<>xx<>I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside.
6841<>xx<>That is why I only gave it four stars.
6842<>xx<>This is a must eat when in Vegas and has been for every trip I have made.
6843<>xx<>Both times I have gotten the sage fried chicken, once atop an eggs benedict and most recently as the famous chicken and waffles.
6844<>xx<>I highly recommend the chicken and waffles, it's all sorts of food goodness.
6845<>xx<>There's bacon infused in the waffles, the chicken is juicy, fried with corn flakes and drizzled with a hot maple reduction, and topped with fried leeks.
6846<>xx<>Awesome!
6847<>xx<>A+ for the bloody mary BLT which came topped with an actual make your own BLT, which was a perfect snack while waiting for our food.
6848<>xx<>Came in around 4am to soak up some alcohol.
6849<>xx<>Was seated quickly and waiter was attentive.
6850<>xx<>I had seen the Man Vs. Food show about this restaurant so I was excited that it was still open.
6851<>xx<>I ordered the bacon, onion& swiss scramble with a stale biscuit apparently.
6852<>xx<>Had about 5 bites and was done.
6853<>xx<>Bathroom was downstairs in the casino, kind of a pain and you can tell the hostess hates having to tell people they have to go back down to the casino.
6854<>xx<>This is my new favorite breakfast place.
6855<>xx<>Too bad it's all the way in Vegas...
6856<>xx<>I had the chocolate chip pancakes with scrambled eggs.
6857<>xx<>I didn't know that they pancakes would be so big, so when I ordered it, I asked how many it came with (to make sure it was enough for me).
6858<>xx<>The waiter said an order came with 1 pancake, and I kind of made a face.
6859<>xx<>He laughed and said they were really big.
6860<>xx<>That was an understatement!
6861<>xx<>The pancakes are HUGE!!!
6862<>xx<>They're probably over a foot in diameter.
6863<>xx<>The chef is not stingy on the chocolate chips either.
6864<>xx<>It was the best pancake I've ever had.
6865<>xx<>My boyfriend got the banana pancake, that was AMAZING too.
6866<>xx<>I will definitely be going back every time I make a visit to Vegas!
6867<>xx<>Great first meal here, but I'm going back.
6868<>xx<>This is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas.
6869<>xx<>The service and food were both excellent.
6870<>xx<>Prices were very reasonable.
6871<>xx<>Portions were huge.
6872<>xx<>The fried chicken and waffles was fantastic.
6873<>xx<>They serve pbr in brown paper bags, a nice touch.
6874<>xx<>I loved this place.
6875<>xx<>This is how a restaurant is supposed to be run.
6876<>xx<>Jason was the best waiter in recent memory.
6877<>xx<>Management, give this worker kudos, he's doing you right.
6878<>xx<>Everyone in here was in a great mood, this is feel good comfort food at its best!
6879<>xx<>Went into HH LV with my heart set on the French Toast with banana cream, pecans, whipped cream.
6880<>xx<>It was dinner and not on the menu.
6881<>xx<>Inquired with the server if I could get it anyway.
6882<>xx<>She politely declined, with reason.
6883<>xx<>I asked her to please inquire with the chef if he would make it for me and she came back to the table with a big yes!
6884<>xx<>Thank you  Krystie, great server, great attitude.
6885<>xx<>Thank you chef!
6886<>xx<>Great staff.
6887<>xx<>Food was excellent and large portions.
6888<>xx<>Will go back next time we are in Vegas.
6889<>xx<>Damn the food was amazing and OMG server Nancy was the best server I had in years (and that's not putting any extras on it) she made my experience good and was great help with the menu and letting me know that the stuff was gonna be big so I might wanna share...but I don't lol, so I hope the bump Nancy up in the company because she deserve it...sweet, patient and knows the menu well....I'll be back prolly for dinner again before I head back LA California.
6890<>xx<>Jus hope the food taste great like last night and I get the same server
6891<>xx<>Excellent fried green tomatoes, and I usually don't even care for tomatoes, salmon was awesome as well.
6892<>xx<>The gigantic portions made me give it 5 stars.
6893<>xx<>The food's visually stunning and beautiful; however, once you get down to eating its quite bland.
6894<>xx<>In a strange way I felt swindled.
6895<>xx<>My initial rating was a "1" star; however, the very reasonable prices and large portions forced me to make an adjustment.
6896<>xx<>Stopped here for a 1am dinner/breakfast!
6897<>xx<>The red pepper and mozzarella burger was delicious, and so was the cucumber ranch dressing on my house salad.
6898<>xx<>The portions are huge!
6899<>xx<>My sister had the French toast and it was also very yummy.
6900<>xx<>Definitely returning on my next trip to Vegas!
6901<>xx<>This is the kind of over the top dining that I like to treat myself to once in a while.
6902<>xx<>Gorgeous white tablecloth service, servers in white sportscoats, beautiful bar.
6903<>xx<>I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit.
6904<>xx<>I had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent.
6905<>xx<>Our table ordered the gnocchi & crab as a side dish.
6906<>xx<>Delicious even for $26.
6907<>xx<>It's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there.
6908<>xx<>However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service.
6909<>xx<>I was back to Vegas with my work team.
6910<>xx<>First time at Mastro's Ocean Club, a restaurant in the middle of Crystal Mall.
6911<>xx<>We booked dinner reservation for 9:45 pm for 6 on Sunday May/18/14 after the Show.
6912<>xx<>I arrived 7 mins early, but our table was not ready and we were seated 10:10 pm (empty table needs to set up for 6).
6913<>xx<>Our waiter was very tentative and recommend us the seafood platter.
6914<>xx<>The Alaskan Red King Crab Claws & the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails were awesome.
6915<>xx<>My Rack of Lamb was cooked medium rare as I requested on a super Hot Plate.
6916<>xx<>Perfect!.
6917<>xx<>The rest of the food and side dishes were great.
6918<>xx<>The only less desirable thing was by the time we got our main course it was 11:40 pm at night.
6919<>xx<>For sure it was a bit pricey, our bill came to $1200 USD for 6 of us.
6920<>xx<>Overall, it was a good experience.
6921<>xx<>Maybe we will try again an earlier dinner time when we have a chance again.
6922<>xx<>I was more into the live entertainment than the food.
6923<>xx<>Bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned.
6924<>xx<>Sides were just aiight - mac and cheese, creamed spinach, clam chowder, salad, mashed potatoes, sauteed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms.
6925<>xx<>Eating in a mall just doesn't feel as nice although we did see Tyson Chandler from the Mavs.
6926<>xx<>I'd come back to try their seafood.
6927<>xx<>This is our 1st time at any of the Mastro's restaurants.
6928<>xx<>We have family & friends in the Vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.
6929<>xx<>They were correct!
6930<>xx<>Upon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated Treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed Captain to recommend the appetizers.
6931<>xx<>He had us create our own "Seafood Tower" and we chose crab claws, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!
6932<>xx<>The Lobster Bisque, Clam Chowder & Iceberg Wedge were next.
6933<>xx<>The five of us then shared a Filet, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Salmon & Scallops with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.
6934<>xx<>Our Captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.
6935<>xx<>Now.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the Mastro's Butter Cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.
6936<>xx<>Needless to say & in keeping with my "positively outrageously" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy Mastro's if you're in Vegas!
6937<>xx<>I wanted to try Mastro's for two reasons: (1) If possible, I would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) I wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in Crystals.
6938<>xx<>I got both (except for death...unless....).
6939<>xx<>The ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.
6940<>xx<>A few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.
6941<>xx<>The rest are inside the "treehouse," a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of Crystals.
6942<>xx<>Although very cool looking, it's VERY LOUD.
6943<>xx<>In between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.
6944<>xx<>I would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.
6945<>xx<>There were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.
6946<>xx<>Like, packs of them.
6947<>xx<>Very weird.
6948<>xx<>FOOD  As we were in a "small plate" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:  Sauteed Sea Scallops ($22)- Three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.
6949<>xx<>Unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy.
6950<>xx<>I'd probably pass on scallops next time.
6951<>xx<>Beef Bone Marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.
6952<>xx<>Delicious, decadent and full of flavor.
6953<>xx<>We gobbled it all up.
6954<>xx<>Seared Ahi Tuna encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).
6955<>xx<>Overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked.
6956<>xx<>Wedge salad - ($12) Big portion and very good.
6957<>xx<>I liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.
6958<>xx<>This allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.
6959<>xx<>The dressing was a tad watery, the way I like it.
6960<>xx<>Well executed.
6961<>xx<>But, it's a salad, so......  Then we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):  King Crab Black Truffle Gnocci - Salty, rich and so delicious.
6962<>xx<>Lots of king crab chunks.
6963<>xx<>My favorite thing I tried.
6964<>xx<>Lobster Cheese Mashed Potatoes -Although rich, it wasn't that flavorful.
6965<>xx<>Mostly salty, not complex.
6966<>xx<>I did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though.
6967<>xx<>I have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of Shiraz).
6968<>xx<>Overall, good service and big portions.
6969<>xx<>It's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.
6970<>xx<>Definitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.
6971<>xx<>This is your mecca.
6972<>xx<>In short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in Vegas.
6973<>xx<>With every element of the meal nearly flawless, I could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience.
6974<>xx<>Yelp here has Mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke!
6975<>xx<>We came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were MORE than exceeded.
6976<>xx<>We were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the "Tree House," as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere.
6977<>xx<>I'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again.
6978<>xx<>As we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals).
6979<>xx<>Big plus for this.
6980<>xx<>After immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing.
6981<>xx<>We didn't even ask.
6982<>xx<>Nice touch.
6983<>xx<>Rob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular.
6984<>xx<>I was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that).
6985<>xx<>Rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes.
6986<>xx<>We like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got!
6987<>xx<>Not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!)
6988<>xx<>Now, where do I even begin...  --Vanilla Battered Shrimp: Caution: Oxymoron...
6989<>xx<>MASSIVE shrimp.
6990<>xx<>The biggest shrimp I've seen in recent memory.
6991<>xx<>The batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless.
6992<>xx<>Three to an order!
6993<>xx<>--Burrata & Heirloom Tomato Salad: Mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites!
6994<>xx<>Yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty.
6995<>xx<>We asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.
6996<>xx<>--Clam Chowder: Hands down the best I've ever had.
6997<>xx<>Not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients.
6998<>xx<>Piping hot when it arrived which I really appreciate with soups.
6999<>xx<>--Mac & Cheese: Ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this.
7000<>xx<>Served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again).
7001<>xx<>On top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...I think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper!
7002<>xx<>--Bone-in Filet Mignon: I really don't like throwing out the "best I've ever had" card very often.
7003<>xx<>Because, honestly, how many things can take that title?
7004<>xx<>Well, this definitely takes the "best filet I've ever had" title.
7005<>xx<>Join the club, clam chowder.
7006<>xx<>It had the taste of a NY Strip, but was tender as a filet should be.
7007<>xx<>And, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate.
7008<>xx<>I like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done.
7009<>xx<>--Warm Butter Cake: Okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended).
7010<>xx<>My mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?)
7011<>xx<>and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday?
7012<>xx<>Out comes this large, circular cake and a BEHEMOTH side of whipped cream.
7013<>xx<>Really.
7014<>xx<>View my picture to see how much there was.
7015<>xx<>Think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream.
7016<>xx<>Fantastic dessert.
7017<>xx<>And what's even better?
7018<>xx<>Rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of "happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight."
7019<>xx<>Winnnnnnn.
7020<>xx<>From now on, every time I'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, Mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth.
7021<>xx<>I cannot wait to go there again next time I've got a few bucks to blow.
7022<>xx<>My new favorite steak and seafood house in Las Vegas.
7023<>xx<>Went again last night and had a magnifcent experience!
7024<>xx<>The manager, Scott, is a terrific guy.
7025<>xx<>Our server, Sylvia, was charming and attentive.
7026<>xx<>And the food... How about a 32 oz bone-in ribeye!!
7027<>xx<>OMG!
7028<>xx<>(I'm just getting out of the hospital now...had my blood cleaned.)
7029<>xx<>It was worth it.
7030<>xx<>That's why Crestor was invented.
7031<>xx<>5/5 stars Service: 5/5 stars Sides: 4.5/5 stars Dessert 4/5 stars  I will do an update after our event in January.
7032<>xx<>Wow!
7033<>xx<>Carly and Brandon were super accommodating and friendly!
7034<>xx<>5 stars just for their service.
7035<>xx<>I flew into Vegas for a day to do some menu tastings for an event in January, and they were super nice.
7036<>xx<>Sides: Creamed of corn: 5/5: Dangerously creamy and delicious!
7037<>xx<>Mac and Cheese: 4/5: Not a fan of mac and cheese personally, but this was delicious Snap sugar peas: 5/5 So fresh--crunchy!
7038<>xx<>Brussels Sprouts: 5/5: Ah, made to perfection--Brussels sprouts is starting to become one of my favorite veggies if done correctly.
7039<>xx<>Desserts Butter Cake: 4/5: It was good, but not GREAT.
7040<>xx<>I guess I am more of a chocolate decadent dessert person.
7041<>xx<>Yes, this was food ALL FOR ONE PERSON!
7042<>xx<>Thank you for a great time!
7043<>xx<>Can't wait to dine here in January!
7044<>xx<>Right after this menu tasting, I headed straight to dinner #2!
7045<>xx<>No doubt a popular venue as judged by our wait even after we had a reservation.
7046<>xx<>Ate my usual bone in filet and was utterly disappointed.
7047<>xx<>In fact I was underwhelmed by every dish that came out.
7048<>xx<>I guess I should have gotten the seafood?
7049<>xx<>This is as good as it gets.
7050<>xx<>Three of us went to Mastro's after deciding on seafood and reading the reviews on Yelp.
7051<>xx<>Everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions.
7052<>xx<>Some of my favorites included the crab cocktail (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, lobster bisque (creamy and with actual meat), and the black truffle crab gnocchi.
7053<>xx<>I had that night's special, which was a fantastic John Dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce.
7054<>xx<>Some of the other "little touches" to make the experience better?
7055<>xx<>The server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction.
7056<>xx<>Very classy!
7057<>xx<>Expect a hit to your wallet: Three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on Grey Goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster.
7058<>xx<>I can assure you it's well worth it!
7059<>xx<>After finding out we had an extra day to spend in Las Vegas, my friend and I happened into Todd English's for lunch.
7060<>xx<>Everything was fantastic from the moment we walked in ( right as they opened at 11).
7061<>xx<>The service was genuine & helpful- we sat at the bar with Ralph and he really made our day.
7062<>xx<>We were searching for a hotel - he reccomended one we never would have otherwise found & it turned out to be an amazing place.
7063<>xx<>The food was very tasty and generously portioned.
7064<>xx<>I had the lobster rolls (another great reccomendation by Ralph) they were buttery and the lobster was nice and tender.
7065<>xx<>The menu is fun and diverse, and they have a superb beer selection.
7066<>xx<>The whole staff was great, loved the atmosphere, overall just a great spot for lunch!
7067<>xx<>We decided to stop in here for some apps and beers after checking out the City Center area.
7068<>xx<>The beer selection here is pretty good with some local craft brews on the menu.
7069<>xx<>The beers in general are a bit pricey tho ($9 for a Stella and $14 for a Delerium Tremens).
7070<>xx<>We sat in the bar area and the atmosphere is very open and comfortable.
7071<>xx<>Easy to hold a conversation and would be a nice place to take a date for drinks.
7072<>xx<>The apps were good.
7073<>xx<>I got the sliders and they were very tasty.
7074<>xx<>However, the service ended up being poor as our waitress seeemed to disappear for about 20 minutes leaving us with empty glasses.
7075<>xx<>I would have gone with three stars but as I came out of the bathroom (the sink area is shared by both guys and gals), a couple girls were giggling and fooling around and ended up making out with each other.
7076<>xx<>Anytime you can go to a bar and see a couple girls play some tonsil hockey with each other deserves an extra star.
7077<>xx<>Good traditional atmosphere and great servers.
7078<>xx<>Great beer selection.
7079<>xx<>Food was okay and over priced.
7080<>xx<>3.5 stars  This is a pretty laid back place right next to Aria.
7081<>xx<>Gotta love those pub height tables with your very own tap!
7082<>xx<>Awesome.
7083<>xx<>There's a great beer selection and if you're at the bar and are up for a challenge you can chug your beer in 7 seconds and get it for free.
7084<>xx<>I guess that's cool if you think chugging a good beer is worth it.
7085<>xx<>When you sit at a table you get a small tin of popcorn to snack on.
7086<>xx<>The food is good but I think the whole thing is a bit overpriced.
7087<>xx<>Happy hour is pretty decent (good deals on beer and appetizers, although if you ask me the price of happy hour apps are probably the price they should be normally).
7088<>xx<>Good outdoor seating for those nice days.
7089<>xx<>I won't be here regularly but when I wind up here for a beer it's usually a good time.
7090<>xx<>If you are on a REAL gluten free diet steer clear of this place.
7091<>xx<>Despite their being "gluten free" markings on the menu and Making it VERY clear to the waitress at the bar that everything I ordered needed to be gluten free.
7092<>xx<>My chili still came with bread and my greek salad came with croutons on it which wasn't apparent until the first bite.
7093<>xx<>After informing her of this and how sick I would get; she acted like it was no big deal.
7094<>xx<>Bad service, so so food.
7095<>xx<>The waitress was covered in tattoos and piercings, which always make me lose my appetite.
7096<>xx<>I ordered soup to start, which was delivered without a spoon.
7097<>xx<>It took me five minutes to flag down a service person, who was surly, not apologetic, as he dropped a teaspoon onto the table and vanished.
7098<>xx<>What happened to soup spoons?
7099<>xx<>The chicken dumplings were good, as was the lobster cocktail.
7100<>xx<>The overhead music was too loud.
7101<>xx<>Came here with a few college friends, so naturally we did the pint challenge.
7102<>xx<>That is a solid deal if you put on your frat boy hat and man up.
7103<>xx<>We ordered some bar food which was ok.
7104<>xx<>The one waitress, who looked like Snooki, must hate her job.
7105<>xx<>She was very unpleasant, which meant no tip for her.
7106<>xx<>I'd suggest stroll in and pound a few free pints, then head elsewhere.
7107<>xx<>Deep down, I was hoping to glimpse the model-gorgeous owner, Todd English.
7108<>xx<>After meeting him at his original Olives in Boston at a private function that he hosted, I still remember what a gracious host he was...even though I couldn't get past how good looking he is in person.
7109<>xx<>Ok...oh yes, I was going to write a review on The Pub...  Fresh fresh seafood  - as soon as you walk in, you see the shrimp and oysters on ice.
7110<>xx<>Raw bar heaven.
7111<>xx<>Great beer selection; moderately priced and great service.
7112<>xx<>Skinny and fat french fries; you have your choice; I like that!
7113<>xx<>Tuna = have it a lot of ways and each way is excellent.
7114<>xx<>Our table had tuna three different ways: the burger, the ahi tuna on wontons, the tuna stack.
7115<>xx<>Outstanding!
7116<>xx<>Very busy.
7117<>xx<>This is a place where you can get in/out in an hour, catch a show, blow your money at the tables and then come back again in the morning for their killer Bloody Mary.
7118<>xx<>Great buzz, open kitchen, clean.
7119<>xx<>Loved it.
7120<>xx<>Easy to see how you could come here a couple times a day.
7121<>xx<>Next time, maybe Todd will be there...or at his Olives inside Bellagio!
7122<>xx<>Good restaurant.
7123<>xx<>Great meat choices.
7124<>xx<>Service was a little slow, especially when the restaruant wasn't even half full.
7125<>xx<>We had a good time though.
7126<>xx<>Good atmosphere.
7127<>xx<>Good value.
7128<>xx<>I've been curious to try Todd English's food for some time now...and I finally got my chance!
7129<>xx<>After seeing him on the pilot run for Iron Chef America and on Top Chef..I always wanted to see what all the hooplah was about....I have to say...I was impressed...  Before coming to this place.....it was between Bezo, the Tapas place or this....something about the smell coming from this Pub called to us so here we went hah....  And we totally weren't disappointed....loved the sknny fries.....burgers were amazing....heck even the pickled vegetables were tasty...who would have thought pickled veggies would be scarfed down in a matter of seconds =P  I ended up ordering the Lobster Rolls with the butter aoli.....man soooooo good!!
7130<>xx<>Guess it was all that darn butter ha...  Oh the servers were quite good looking too....well one of the guys looked like a legal Taylor Lautner lol....our server was this tall lean guy....really pleasant and had great customer service...did I mention he was cute ^_^  Anyhoo...I'll stop rambling ha....try this place if you want to see a sports game or just go for a nice relaxing time with good folks  =)
7131<>xx<>Essentially a sports bar, but has a more upscale flair.
7132<>xx<>The decor is nice, and has very open layout--so an get a bit noisy.
7133<>xx<>So be aware if you planned on having dinner conversation.
7134<>xx<>But because of the open atmosphere, it is great for groups and people watching.
7135<>xx<>I actually love the breakfast here.
7136<>xx<>It isn't as popular as some of the other spots on Scottsdale strip--so you can get seated and served rather quick.
7137<>xx<>Also, it is a quick jaunt from the local farmers market, so you can stroll around afterwards.
7138<>xx<>The food is really good, fresh and well presented.
7139<>xx<>I order hot tea for breakfast frequently-- and usually I just get an old Lipton bag with Luke warm water.
7140<>xx<>This place gave me a nice tray with quality tea, lemon slices and piping hot water in nice mug.
7141<>xx<>Their side of fruit is also very nice -- you get a cup of fresh berries instead of the standard old honeydew chunks.
7142<>xx<>Dinner is equally nice.
7143<>xx<>You have the standard sports bar options (burgers, fries, etc.
7144<>xx<>), but presentation and quality is stepped up a notch.
7145<>xx<>We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks.
7146<>xx<>I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot.
7147<>xx<>Order it!
7148<>xx<>So delicious!
7149<>xx<>Need to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome.
7150<>xx<>This is a great place to sit on the patio when it's nice out and people watch (all the bros and all the older rich couples) in downtown Scottsdale.
7151<>xx<>The service and management are phenomenal and super welcoming!
7152<>xx<>I especially recommend the Mac & Cheese.
7153<>xx<>it's ridiculous!!!!
7154<>xx<>(ask for bacon!!!)
7155<>xx<>Give it a whirl!
7156<>xx<>I have been here several times with friends, usually for happy hour, and I have been satisfied each time.
7157<>xx<>The drinks are good and the food is really good- I recommend the sweet potato tots, awesome.
7158<>xx<>My last trip was for brunch to try their $15 bottomless mimosas as advertised on their little a-frame.
7159<>xx<>When we ordered we are informed that in order to get the bottomless drinks, we would have to order breakfast- perf!
7160<>xx<>We were there for the food too.
7161<>xx<>So, besides having to order food, there is no catch.
7162<>xx<>The only problem, you can't get any refills after 2pm.
7163<>xx<>My recommendation, go early and hungry then enjoy the constant flow of oj and champagne.
7164<>xx<>Food and service was great, however, the techno music really took away from a four star review.
7165<>xx<>Don't get me wrong, that kind of music has a place at the dance clubs, but not while I am trying to enjoy the game, and the company of my friends.
7166<>xx<>Located in old town Scottsdale, stumbled on this place after a San Francisco Giants game.
7167<>xx<>Place is amazing, incredible beer selection on tab, great choices of craft beers.
7168<>xx<>The food selection goes hand in hand with the ambiance, definitely order the animal fries, they speak for themselves.
7169<>xx<>It's a place to visit of in old town Scottsdale.
7170<>xx<>Service and staff is beyond incredible.
7171<>xx<>MUST HAVE A RESERVATION for brunch.
7172<>xx<>Or plan on waiting around a good part of your morning to be seated.
7173<>xx<>Would be ok if you are taking advantage of the bottomless drinks.
7174<>xx<>The place is on the side of the street where you are not getting hammered in sun even if you sit on any of the out door seating!
7175<>xx<>So a prime spot for the heat of the summer.
7176<>xx<>Pricing was so-so.
7177<>xx<>To take advantage of the $15 bottomless drinks you must each have a full entree.
7178<>xx<>So out check before tip was $70.
7179<>xx<>If you don't get the "Veggie Tacos (what the heck are these?!)"
7180<>xx<>or the Queso Dip, you'll be fine... probably.
7181<>xx<>I do love the $15 bottomless Mimosas!
7182<>xx<>I'll be back... not going to lie.
7183<>xx<>This place is unbelievable IF: you are there for a bachelor/bachelorette party, out with friends for a crazy brunch, or love mimosas/bloody marys/music.
7184<>xx<>If you want a low key brunch- this is not the spot for you.
7185<>xx<>We absolutely loved it- but we were there with 6 girls who wanted more atmosphere than good food for a bachelorette party.
7186<>xx<>Music is very very loud- so not the spot to sit and chat.
7187<>xx<>AND it was a Sunday.
7188<>xx<>Bottomless mimosas are unbelievable.
7189<>xx<>My food was great- but one girl didn't like her salad Only suggestion for this bar would be to get some slightly friendlier staff- that would have made the experience awesome.. but our waiter sucked.
7190<>xx<>Great time on a Fall Saturday afternoon!
7191<>xx<>Good music, college football, and good looking people.
7192<>xx<>But...service could have been better.
7193<>xx<>Price to taste ratio is pretty high, yet overall, fairly solid burger and fries.
7194<>xx<>This is a fantastic spot.
7195<>xx<>The dining room itself is fairly small, but there's a lot patio space outside.
7196<>xx<>I'm not too sure how I'd feel about that on a very hot or cold day, but it's great for a temperate night.
7197<>xx<>The burgers are amazing.
7198<>xx<>Zinburger has a small selection, with a few toppings, and you can add plenty of other fixings for a couple of dollars.
7199<>xx<>I had their special of the week.
7200<>xx<>The name of it already escaped me, but it was topped with guacamole and pico de gallo, and was unbelievable.
7201<>xx<>They also serve phenomenal sweet potato fries.
7202<>xx<>For desert we split one of their milkshakes.
7203<>xx<>It was creme brulee shake.
7204<>xx<>It was good.
7205<>xx<>The shakes are 20 ounces, so sharing was probably a good way to go.
7206<>xx<>The staff is really friendly, and the food came out.
7207<>xx<>fast  The drinks were also refilled on a regular basis, and super quick.
7208<>xx<>Yeah, it's a little overpriced for burgers but it is not out of the norm compared to other joints like this ie; Coal Burger, Modern Burger, etc...  We have eaten here two times.
7209<>xx<>Both times I ordered the Zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli.
7210<>xx<>Both times it was great.
7211<>xx<>I will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food.
7212<>xx<>One order is enough to split between two people.
7213<>xx<>The milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to Biltmore.
7214<>xx<>Definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend.
7215<>xx<>Other than watching others get to eat before you, I have no complaints.
7216<>xx<>Good service, good food, good restaurant!
7217<>xx<>My burger melted in my mouth!
7218<>xx<>I ordered the "el diablo", and we all shared zucchini fries, sweet potato fries, as well as onion rings.
7219<>xx<>So very tasty.
7220<>xx<>I had a glass of chardonnay, and although everything was cooked to perfection, this place would have gotten five stars if it weren't too expensive for everything ordered.
7221<>xx<>Not to mention the hostess forgot to give us kids menus and were not brought to us till it was time to go.
7222<>xx<>We basically just had to ask if they served kid burgers, no big deal.
7223<>xx<>But we will be back next time we are craving melt in your mouth burgers.
7224<>xx<>Oh, and happy hour looks like a great time to fill up on wine and food for the best prices.
7225<>xx<>Best burger in town by far.
7226<>xx<>I am a gourmet food salesman and these guys do not buy from me so it pains me to admit it, but the burger is second to none.
7227<>xx<>Believe it.
7228<>xx<>I had the kobe burger, out of this world.
7229<>xx<>we met some friends here last night.
7230<>xx<>knowing this was a fox restaurant ensured that we were going to have great food and great service.
7231<>xx<>luckily, they had already gotten a table because when we arrived, we heard there was an hour wait!
7232<>xx<>the dining area is typical of fox...clean lines, open kitchen.
7233<>xx<>and of his staff...extraordinarily friendly and helpful.
7234<>xx<>they offered a few meatless selections, including a veggie burger and some great salads.
7235<>xx<>i opted for a napa salad with almonds and ahi tuna.
7236<>xx<>it took forever to come out, but when it did, it was super flavorful and tasty.
7237<>xx<>add to that a side of sweet potato fries which tasted like sweet potatoes and not salt!
7238<>xx<>what a wonderful concept!
7239<>xx<>with such a large group, there was bound to be confusion come bill time.
7240<>xx<>it took about 30 minutes for the group to figure out what to do, and all the while, our server never missed a beat and did whatever was helpful to the group.
7241<>xx<>luckily, we paid on our own so we didn't have an issue, but she deserved a great tip.
7242<>xx<>water glasses filled constantly.
7243<>xx<>reasonable prices and another great experience at the fox enterprise.
7244<>xx<>Monday night was a big one for me.
7245<>xx<>First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.
7246<>xx<>So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one.
7247<>xx<>So we went to zinburger.
7248<>xx<>I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry.
7249<>xx<>Sooo.
7250<>xx<>We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.
7251<>xx<>The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.
7252<>xx<>Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.
7253<>xx<>It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.
7254<>xx<>The flavor was sublime.
7255<>xx<>We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.
7256<>xx<>It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.
7257<>xx<>For $3!!
7258<>xx<>My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.
7259<>xx<>Well she actually said she liked it.
7260<>xx<>It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite.
7261<>xx<>Really though, the food was phenomenal.
7262<>xx<>I have tried this place a few times now and I am just not impressed enough to go back again.
7263<>xx<>I have tried a few of the burgers and one of the salads and it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't memorable either.
7264<>xx<>Even though we are loyal Delux clients...we tried Zinburger cause I have heard amazing raves from friends.
7265<>xx<>Short wait which was nice...our waiter was a total grump though.
7266<>xx<>He could have at leased faked one smile.
7267<>xx<>Our burgers were actually really good!
7268<>xx<>The sweet potato fries not so much.
7269<>xx<>Delux fries are wayyy better.
7270<>xx<>the best food.
7271<>xx<>the server that is great is justin, and the manager barry(female)  try the coffee latte shake and ask for hagan dazs coffee ice cream to make it with, the place is amazing.
7272<>xx<>not for kids.
7273<>xx<>4.25 star.
7274<>xx<>I had the turkey panini with new Mexico chilis.
7275<>xx<>Very good.
7276<>xx<>Moist, immense primary flavor.
7277<>xx<>Clear secondary flavor of the NM chili.
7278<>xx<>Bread was oily and hard at the edges.
7279<>xx<>Crispy and soft in the middle.
7280<>xx<>Sweet potato fries were good.
7281<>xx<>Each fry had salt flakes attached.
7282<>xx<>Not the best I had, but above average for sure.
7283<>xx<>Price is worth it.
7284<>xx<>They have an interesting menu that is definitely worth trying a couple of things.
7285<>xx<>I normally just grade food quality, but I must add that the service was prompt, polite, friendly and great.
7286<>xx<>If I graded on service, they would get 5 stars for sure.
7287<>xx<>I would recommend this place and I will be coming back.
7288<>xx<>Food took forever to come out.
7289<>xx<>By the time we got the food, we were disappointed with the food.
7290<>xx<>The food was tasteless, hard, and pricey.
7291<>xx<>We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.
7292<>xx<>When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.
7293<>xx<>Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.
7294<>xx<>Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.
7295<>xx<>They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.
7296<>xx<>You've read myriad reviews about the inventive drinks, meals and deserts.
7297<>xx<>I completely agree with the raves.
7298<>xx<>What I love about this place is the relaxed, no-rush attitude.
7299<>xx<>I'll be honest, if you are in a hurry to order, eat, pay and run, let them know as soon as you are seated.
7300<>xx<>You'll get a little more attention from your servers during weeknights.
7301<>xx<>The weekends and Sunday Brunch are usually a raucous, madhouse setting.
7302<>xx<>If you decide to join them for the party be prepared for bottomless "All Day" mimosas, a long wait to be seated and lots of time at your table.
7303<>xx<>Personally I love the fact that I can share a drink or two at the bar with friends and take our time without ever feeling rushed by staff trying to flip tables.
7304<>xx<>A few suggestions:  1.
7305<>xx<>Dine during the week for the most attentive service and less noise.
7306<>xx<>2.
7307<>xx<>The daily specials are always amazing.
7308<>xx<>3.
7309<>xx<>Specialty cocktails are worth a try.
7310<>xx<>Beware: some are very sweet and very strong.
7311<>xx<>4.
7312<>xx<>Feel free to bring a bottle of wine from your own cellar, they are very accommodating.
7313<>xx<>5.
7314<>xx<>Remember, most of the flavors are bold and spicy.
7315<>xx<>6.
7316<>xx<>Sunday brunch is a time for friends and good times, be prepared for an event, not simply a meal.
7317<>xx<>Schedule accordingly.
7318<>xx<>7.
7319<>xx<>Come back regularly and bring your friends.
7320<>xx<>Good Eating!
7321<>xx<>party - 5 when walking in (since we did so separately) the atmosphere was great, being seating and not being pressured by the wanting of being in and out.
7322<>xx<>as we were seated the service was great, got drinks within a min being greeted by the owner and just walking to our seats.
7323<>xx<>the automatic water dispense of water was amazing and the accommodations to what ever drink you would like the have.
7324<>xx<>Me having the lemonade (it was a little lemony but upon request it could be sweetened) and with their pomegranate white ice tea was a good choice, light, aromatic and delicious (highly recommended).
7325<>xx<>as we moved on we started with a salad and starter dish, being their torte and jerked tuna salad.
7326<>xx<>the torte itself was light and refreshing and it hit the spot (if needing to curve your appetite this was the right choice) with some crunch, abundance of flavors and spices, and richness of the cheese it was an amazing choice to have.
7327<>xx<>our second started (actually being an entree) we had the jerked ahi tuna salad.
7328<>xx<>the salad was surprising it has sweet, spicy, freshness and all the flavors after tossing was impeccable.
7329<>xx<>main courses - with presentation being a high must all the dishes look amazing and with your burger/sandwich the choice of salad or sweet potato fries give a good health or substance benefactor.
7330<>xx<>then the burger (myself getting the turkey burger) was more than a surprise.
7331<>xx<>After a peer saying it was amazing the the staff giving it good marks i just wanted to try it and it was nothing less than expectation.
7332<>xx<>it was juicy,  filling and great combination of flavors and the chutney gave it an over the roof kick.
7333<>xx<>all went well our stay didnt seemed rushed (being a 2 hour sit time) and all was impeccable.
7334<>xx<>definitely a must eat for lunch dinner and weekend brunch they have an amazing menu if ever in the south west.
7335<>xx<>[recommended] Wasatch White Ale Pesto Torte Mac and Cheese With Truffle Oil DW Homemade cornbread Braised Oxtail DW Fried Chicken Pan Seared Salmon  [comments] It's not just delicious, it's genius.
7336<>xx<>I've been here several times and tried something new each time despite the overwhelming urge to just repeat the order from the previous visit.
7337<>xx<>The dishes aren't cooked as much as they're crafted; everything is deliberate down to the garnishes.
7338<>xx<>Clean your plate without shame.
7339<>xx<>Finally got to try the much touted DW Bistro today for brunch!
7340<>xx<>Loved the decor and atmosphere (it was loud in main portion of restaurant but we were seated in the other area which was great!).
7341<>xx<>The service was top-notch- all of the servers were attentive and personable.
7342<>xx<>We started off with drinks-3 of us had the pomegranate iced tea- ( Re-Fresh-ing!
7343<>xx<>)-my husband asked for a Guinness beer.
7344<>xx<>Server earned brownie points for asking whether my husband would prefer a chilled or room temperature glass.
7345<>xx<>Two of us ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich with jalapeno bacon, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo accompanied by the DW salad or sweet potato fries (I chose the fries).
7346<>xx<>It was a perfect sandwich!
7347<>xx<>The fries were delicious and I am usually not a fan of SP fries.
7348<>xx<>My husband ordered the Chilaquiles  (white corn tortilla with chicken, Chilaquiles sauce, cheddar cheese, two eggs,  pico de gallo, lime infused sour cream, avocado tomatillo sauce and queso fresco).
7349<>xx<>He loved it but did say he would have declared it perfect if it had chunks of avocado instead of the sauce.
7350<>xx<>Our fourth person had the Caesar salad with chicken (whole romaine served with crostini, shaved parmesan, and DW signature Caesar  dressing)- the server asked if our friend would like the romaine chopped beforehand- nice touch.
7351<>xx<>All of the food was plated beautifully (and had I not seen the over 500 pics already on Yelp I would have taken pics myself but my resolution for the year was to quit annoying my friends by insisting on photographing their food!)
7352<>xx<>We finished the meal with the  famous Carrot Cake.
7353<>xx<>It was beautifully presented and as good as every previous Yelper has claimed it to be.
7354<>xx<>I saw several other items I wanted to try so we will be back!!!
7355<>xx<>I have to say that the food and concept seems similar to Honey Salt but if I had to choose, I would pick DW Bistro!
7356<>xx<>Went to DW Bistro for brunch today with a large rowdy family with some picky eaters.
7357<>xx<>They accomdated us and the little ones well.
7358<>xx<>The service was outstanding, the cocktails and food were phenomeonal.
7359<>xx<>Can't wait to go back to try for lunch or dinner.
7360<>xx<>Everyone at our table was pleased with what they ordered.
7361<>xx<>I had the nicoise salad, the tuna was seared perfectly.
7362<>xx<>Others had a mix of their breakfast items, like chocolate pancakes to please the kids, and the jamaician hash.
7363<>xx<>Definitely a new favourite place to go.
7364<>xx<>Great service!
7365<>xx<>Great decor!
7366<>xx<>Great food!
7367<>xx<>Great time!
7368<>xx<>Went with a bunch of my girlfriends for a birthday dinner, and we all had a great time!
7369<>xx<>The wait staff was very friendly and fast!
7370<>xx<>I had the short ribs and liked it but felt it needed a little more flavor something was missing either salt or a seasoning it just needed one more thing, but I would def recommend it and get it again (prob just add salt myself) the daily mash that came with is was DELICIOUS and the vegetables that came with it, eehhh I could of done without.
7371<>xx<>Other menu items ordered was the salmon (which I had a taste and LOVED!
7372<>xx<>I thought it was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside) and fried chicken (my friends didn't like it).
7373<>xx<>All in all we had a blast and I will def be back .
7374<>xx<>OHHHHH I can't BELIEVE I almost forgot to mention the Jerk Calamari TO DIE FOR!
7375<>xx<>I would eat this everyday!
7376<>xx<>Even non calamari and non seafood eaters at our table LOVED IT!
7377<>xx<>If I lived in the region, I would make a point of eating my way through the full DW menu.
7378<>xx<>(Actually, I'd move or shoot myself, but let's just pretend.)
7379<>xx<>We stopped by during their Sunday brunch madness, found ourselves staring down an hour wait, and opted for food to-go on our way to the desert.
7380<>xx<>The staff at DW is impressively competent and friendly.
7381<>xx<>They're essentially wrangling a herd of ravenous socialites with the attention spans and attention demands of toddlers, and they do so admirably.
7382<>xx<>Not surprisingly, we ordered Jerk Chicken & Waffles as well as the Jerk Pork Hash.
7383<>xx<>Both meats were nicely cooked and the portions were perfect.
7384<>xx<>If you're still reading, you're no doubt wondering why this isn't a four-star review.
7385<>xx<>Two reasons: 1.
7386<>xx<>Their jerk seasoning is much too timid.
7387<>xx<>You get the allspice, some herbs, and citrus (there's even some additional orange rind on the waffles), but the habanero heat is a no show.
7388<>xx<>It doesn't move far enough beyond regular chicken & waffles.
7389<>xx<>2.
7390<>xx<>I am not a weirdo who carries condiments in my man-purse, but I'm officially designating DW as a B.Y.O.Syrup establishment.
7391<>xx<>It's a sad moment when you find yourself wishing you could un-pour the sticky sweetness you just splashed all over your waffles and chicken (for the record, you cannot).
7392<>xx<>You know that irrevocable moment when you dump way too much brandy or Grand Marnier into your recipe and convert the whole dish into a boozy mess?
7393<>xx<>We've all done it, and we'll probably do it again.
7394<>xx<>With luck, DW only did it on the day we visited.
7395<>xx<>The syrup was odd, overbearing, and unfortunate.
7396<>xx<>You have been warned.
7397<>xx<>This is NOT the place to go if you have anywhere to head to afterwards.
7398<>xx<>Went in during the work week, it is right around the corner from my office.
7399<>xx<>Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).
7400<>xx<>We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.
7401<>xx<>At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.
7402<>xx<>12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..
7403<>xx<>I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.
7404<>xx<>I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.
7405<>xx<>He asked what I wanted him to do about it.
7406<>xx<>I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.
7407<>xx<>If it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.
7408<>xx<>Give them the opportunity to walk out.
7409<>xx<>Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!
7410<>xx<>This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!
7411<>xx<>Will never go back, I don't care how great their burgers are.
7412<>xx<>from out of town and have heard about this place from friends.
7413<>xx<>We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and there was an hour wait.
7414<>xx<>We could not wait because we had plans.
7415<>xx<>We returned Sunday evening for dinner and got seated right away.
7416<>xx<>My table had the stir fried edamame with garlic, chili, and ginger.
7417<>xx<>yummm!
7418<>xx<>We also had a miyagi-san, green and blue burger, and kalbi burger.
7419<>xx<>They were all fabulous!
7420<>xx<>The truffle parkesan fries are addicting!
7421<>xx<>I would give it 6 stars if I can.
7422<>xx<>This is the most favorite burger I've experienced so far.
7423<>xx<>If you're visiting las Vegas, make sure you stop by.
7424<>xx<>Restaurant was full house so I've waited 15 mins befor getting seated.
7425<>xx<>Everyone works for the place was super nice and friendly.
7426<>xx<>I actually didn't feel like it had been 15 mins.
7427<>xx<>Our waitress, Melissa, welcomed my group with big warm smile and explained menu items in detail since we let her know it was our first visit.
7428<>xx<>We probably waited more than 20 mins for our food.
7429<>xx<>However, its well WORTH the wait!!
7430<>xx<>After my first bite of spicy miso burger, it made me want to sing at the table... yes it was just that good!!
7431<>xx<>Angus beef was cooked perfectly.
7432<>xx<>The medium cooked patty was very juicy and tender.
7433<>xx<>I enjoyed the balance flavors between Japanese shishito peppers, egg and Angus beef.
7434<>xx<>My salivary glands kick in overdrive when I tried to picture that burger and write this review.
7435<>xx<>I also sampled Kiki's burger and Bachi house salad.
7436<>xx<>They both tasted pretty awesome.
7437<>xx<>I liked my Spicy Miso burger better.
7438<>xx<>I was pretty impressed with their house salad.
7439<>xx<>It came with pretty good portion and had mixed greens, avocado, walnuts and yuzu orange vinaigrette in it.
7440<>xx<>This place has truely won 5 stars in my Yelp book with its mouthwatering food, friendly price and supreme customer services.
7441<>xx<>I will be back very soon to try Shogun Burger (wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared miso foie gras, poached Asian pear, yuzu butter and yamamomo peach)
7442<>xx<>My friends went on and on about how awesome this place was.
7443<>xx<>They saw this air on T.V.
7444<>xx<>and have been fans every since.
7445<>xx<>So I agreed to meet them there.
7446<>xx<>They have some very bizarre "Policies" that you should know about.
7447<>xx<>First, when I walked in, I asked to be put on the wait list.
7448<>xx<>They do not put you down on the wait list until all parties have arrived per "policy".
7449<>xx<>So, had to wait for their arrival.
7450<>xx<>Meanwhile, the place was cramped with people waiting to be seated.
7451<>xx<>I witnessed many people come in and leave because of the 45 minute wait (It's 1pm mind you).
7452<>xx<>We were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.
7453<>xx<>He spoke not one word to us.
7454<>xx<>I was shocked and starving.
7455<>xx<>Finally, another waiter comes by and takes our order.
7456<>xx<>I ordered just a regular bachi burger and asked for a second to be cut in half.
7457<>xx<>By "policy" they do not cut the food for you, but they'll bring you a knife.
7458<>xx<>What kind of place is this?
7459<>xx<>The burgers finally come out and I was very disappointed.
7460<>xx<>The outside of the burger was almost charred, the inside very dry.
7461<>xx<>Plus, it wasn't served with any fries.
7462<>xx<>You have to order those extra!!
7463<>xx<>Wow.
7464<>xx<>Would have been nice if the server had told me that when I was ordering.
7465<>xx<>The food was overpriced.
7466<>xx<>a lemonade was $4.00  They're trying to be this snobbish burger joint when really it's not all that.
7467<>xx<>Seriously?
7468<>xx<>I will never go there again.
7469<>xx<>Oh, and by the way, their waiters are rude and don't even talk to you.
7470<>xx<>I looked on the receipt and now I know why.
7471<>xx<>Because their tips are included.
7472<>xx<>They feel like they're getting tipped regardless, so they can treat you however they please.
7473<>xx<>I do not understand why people think this place is so great.
7474<>xx<>Flies and (possible) case of mild food poisoning.
7475<>xx<>Well, originally I would have only taken off a single star for being too cheap to serve Coke, and instead having Pepsi.
7476<>xx<>I've personally never heard a customer explicitly ask for a Pepsi, but I have seen people change their drink order from Coke to water, once they are informed apologetically that the restaurant only serves Pepsi.
7477<>xx<>I've never understood why owners would consider saving a couple of bucks a month more important than giving customers what they want.
7478<>xx<>As for the food itself, it was very good.
7479<>xx<>I also found the pineapple ketchup to be unique and very tasty.
7480<>xx<>The real problem was that the place was full of flies!
7481<>xx<>It was pretty difficult to enjoy my food while defending it, and myself from the flies.
7482<>xx<>It was pretty disconcerting when one actually flew into my ear!
7483<>xx<>I noticed that I wasn't the only customer spending his time trying to swat the flies away.
7484<>xx<>When the waiter came by to ask me if I needed anything, I told him that I could use a fly swatter.
7485<>xx<>Apparently, judging by the smirk, he either didn't get the not so subtle hint, or couldn't be bothered with trying to fix the problem.
7486<>xx<>Upon leaving, I noticed that they were doing work outside on the chairs.
7487<>xx<>Most likely they couldn't be bothered with closing the back door.
7488<>xx<>Of course, this was only a mild discomfort, compared to the stomachache and three hurried trips to the bathroom a few hours later.
7489<>xx<>Without expounding too much about what was happening to my GI system, I'm pretty sure the food gave me a mild case of food poisoning.
7490<>xx<>I'll not be returning to or recommending this restaurant.
7491<>xx<>Maybe this is the real meaning of, "bachi".
7492<>xx<>This review is for the Bachi Burger on Windmill.
7493<>xx<>My boyfriend and I arrived there on a Sunday afternoon (8/04/12), at exactly 12 PM after a grocery run.
7494<>xx<>Perfect, we thought, as Bachi Burger Windmill opens at 12 PM on Sunday.
7495<>xx<>We thought wrong.
7496<>xx<>An estimated 40-50 minute wait until the time to be seated.
7497<>xx<>There were about 3 groups before us taking all the seating inside so we waited outside.
7498<>xx<>It would have been great if there were chairs outside.
7499<>xx<>Seated after a 30 minutes, so still less than the anticipated wait.
7500<>xx<>We were starving, and placed our food orders and drink orders as soon as the waitress arrived.
7501<>xx<>The atmosphere was clean and cool; a small dig with wooden chairs and tables, echoing the Japanese flavors of the food.
7502<>xx<>Boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Guava Milkshake and Kalbi Burger.
7503<>xx<>I ordered the Boba Almond Milk Tea and after a hefty debate in my head between the No Meat Here Burger and Kiki's Burger, Kiki's won.
7504<>xx<>We shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.
7505<>xx<>Our fries and drink arrived first.
7506<>xx<>My almond boba milk tea was good and refreshing; nothing to rave too much about.
7507<>xx<>Boyfriend's strawberry guava milkshake was sweet and a little too heavy for me on the ice cream, but he quite enjoyed it.
7508<>xx<>The truffle fries are another story; crispy and not too oily, the black truffle porcini and parmesan roggiano went well with the potatoes.
7509<>xx<>The sun dried aioli was a delicious condiment to the fries.
7510<>xx<>Our burgers arrived about 20 minutes after our drinks, along with a steak knife to cut into them haha.
7511<>xx<>I was completely ravenous at this point, unfulfilled with just fries and milk tea, so I wanted to scarf my burger down but I resisted.
7512<>xx<>I truly enjoyed every aspect of my burger.
7513<>xx<>The shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, sweet caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese...heavenly.
7514<>xx<>I didn't use too much of the garlic aioli sauce on my burger as the flavors of the burger were enough.
7515<>xx<>Boyfriend's kalbi burger was good; I think he enjoyed it more than the sample bite he gave me though haha.
7516<>xx<>We left with half of my burger and a quarter of his burger in a doggy bag.
7517<>xx<>Full, content, and excited to try the other menu at Summerlin the next time a burger craving kicks.
7518<>xx<>The wait was horrendous but seems unavoidable at any time, the place is poppin and I can understand why.
7519<>xx<>Bachi Burger, we are new fans.
7520<>xx<>I found about about Bachi Burger watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.
7521<>xx<>As I was watching, I realized this restaurant was practically in my back yard.
7522<>xx<>I read reviews and realized there might be a wait to eat, so chose a Sunday at 3:00 (in between lunch and dinner) to eat.
7523<>xx<>The wait was about 20 minutes.
7524<>xx<>I have since been back 1/2 dozen or so times.
7525<>xx<>The oxtail chili cheese fries are the BEST!!
7526<>xx<>I have ordered them every visit.
7527<>xx<>I've tasted about 4 or 5 of the burgers and they are all delish!
7528<>xx<>The buns are light and sweet.
7529<>xx<>There are different flavored aiolis if you are eating plain fries instead of chili cheese ones.
7530<>xx<>I recommend the garlic or the pesto aioli.
7531<>xx<>The service can be quite slow at times, and occasionally the wait time for a table can be 45 minutes.
7532<>xx<>For me, it's definitely worth the wait.
7533<>xx<>Ive been here 3 times already.
7534<>xx<>This place is the best burger joint in the world..
7535<>xx<>I would eat here everyday but too bad I live in california.
7536<>xx<>Everyone eat here!!
7537<>xx<>It's clean, the staff is friendly, nice interior, and awesome food!
7538<>xx<>Okay im going to eat my food now haha
7539<>xx<>I'm dinging this place because the front of house is absolute trash, the food is wonderful but twice in a row now they have lost our place on the waiting list and seated 3+ parties that came in after us before and then when I inquire I watch the host stare at a bunch of illegible chicken scratch and pretend he knew where our name was there is no reason there should be a 45 Minute wait on a Monday next time Ill just go elsewhere which is a crying shame because the food is wonderful Edit: Chris is an awesome waiter the review is in no way a reflection of the service he provided sit in his section if you can get seated!
7540<>xx<>A little overpriced for the quality.
7541<>xx<>The filet mignon was not as tender as anyone in my party would have liked.
7542<>xx<>Also, the truffle butter as a topping for the steak was an extra $12.
7543<>xx<>It's a beautiful restaurant, great and friendly service.
7544<>xx<>This was my first fine dining experience and I was expecting to be blown away by the food, but I was sadly underwhelmed.
7545<>xx<>Overall, everything was tasty but nothing really stood out as being spectacular.
7546<>xx<>Maybe the lack of originality was to blame.
7547<>xx<>Atmosphere: very hip and clubby  Food:   filet medallion with foie gras: the filet was tender.
7548<>xx<>The foie gras was good but too rich for my taste.
7549<>xx<>truffled mac and cheese: ok   mushroom pot pie: delicious.
7550<>xx<>kind of wished we ordered two.
7551<>xx<>bread: the green dipping sauce that came with it was the highlight of the meal.
7552<>xx<>cucumber martini: pretty good
7553<>xx<>This place is amazing...Girls night out in Vegas...blue cheese bread....oh my...seafood platter...orgasmic...I had the lamb and we shared the mushroom pot pie..to die for, mac and cheese and asparagus...all amazing!
7554<>xx<>Dirty martini...blue cheese stuffed olives...AMAZING.
7555<>xx<>James was our server and he was soooo great.
7556<>xx<>THUMBS UP GO HERE!
7557<>xx<>STK, Fantastic food and ambiance.
7558<>xx<>A bit on the loud side and your wifi won't work.
7559<>xx<>But, I can ignore my phone for an hour while filet mignon oscar style melts in my mouth.
7560<>xx<>The ambiance is 5 stars here, really sleek, totally Vegas/LA.
7561<>xx<>Great dinner DJ (we were here the night Whitney Houston died, RIP, and he played a tribute mix to her).
7562<>xx<>Food was just OK.
7563<>xx<>I've had better, I've had worse.
7564<>xx<>My scallops (the "special" of the day) were undercooked with a ton of sand grains in them.
7565<>xx<>Unacceptable for the price.
7566<>xx<>... and for the price, I expected more of a wow factor, but must remind myself, I knew I came to an over-hyped LA joint in LV and should know what to expect by now (mild disappointment).
7567<>xx<>So, if you want a hip dinner at a fun new hotel, enjoy!
7568<>xx<>If you are expecting knowledgeable service with some serious cooking, try elsewhere like Nob Hill or Mastro's.
7569<>xx<>Made reservations for a Sat night, no issues there.
7570<>xx<>Embiance is live, beautiful setting, with loud club music!
7571<>xx<>Ordered Risotto to kick things off, but the rice was not properly cooked.
7572<>xx<>(Uncooked) Ordered ribeye and asked specifically to make sure the meat is cooked Med Rare for myself and a buddy, both came out almost Med Well.
7573<>xx<>Another friends pork chop came out Med Rare.
7574<>xx<>So far, the dining experience was dismal at best.
7575<>xx<>However, server salvaged it.
7576<>xx<>Talked to her Mgr, he came by and apologized.
7577<>xx<>Got us 3 new entrees (properly cooked), then the chef came out and chatted us up for a bit (and apologized).
7578<>xx<>They then brought out 3 complimentary desserts for us, then knocked off 25% off the entire bill which was a complete surprise.
7579<>xx<>I give them mad props for being service oriented, cordial, and squashing our dining issues immediately.
7580<>xx<>Had the food been cooked properly from the get go, I'd have gladly given them a well deserved 4 Stars.
7581<>xx<>Perhaps next time.
7582<>xx<>Amazing!
7583<>xx<>Steak cooked to perfection - great wine selection - great service.
7584<>xx<>Can't say anything to change... we'll be back again!
7585<>xx<>I stopped in for cocktails only, but the environment is phenomenal.
7586<>xx<>Savory steaks and full bodied wines!
7587<>xx<>We were sat immediately and the service was attentive but not overwhelming.
7588<>xx<>Solid wine list to accompany a traditional bevvy of mouthwatering meats.
7589<>xx<>I enjoyed every bite of the NY Strip and for Vegas I considered the prices to be fairly reasonable.
7590<>xx<>We paired with a few bottles of Stags Leap cab and let the night unfold.
7591<>xx<>My only complaint is that it is extremely loud.
7592<>xx<>The Cosmopolitan is the hot spot and therefore attracts a younger, more lively crowd than many of the strip staples.
7593<>xx<>All-in-all a good experience and I would return provided the opportunity.
7594<>xx<>Went here for the final night of our Vegas trip.
7595<>xx<>Had a great meal, much better than 35 Steak + Martini's.
7596<>xx<>Beautifully designed space but the music was deafening.
7597<>xx<>Had the skirt steak & mac and cheese.
7598<>xx<>Friends had the short ribs, lamb chops, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and filet.
7599<>xx<>They all loved their meals.
7600<>xx<>Prices are not for the faint of heart.
7601<>xx<>Definitely a place you should give a try.
7602<>xx<>Let's be anhest, day clubs are just ass and tits for both males and females.
7603<>xx<>Probably my favorite Day Club, I just love the Wynn and Encore in general and I still haven't tried their buffet yet.
7604<>xx<>Comparing this to Wet Republic is like Night and Day.
7605<>xx<>Encore is a much more classier feel.
7606<>xx<>The asian theme of Red and Gold makes it a lot more upscale.
7607<>xx<>The crowd as well.
7608<>xx<>The pretty life guards dances to the music as well when compared to other Day clubs.
7609<>xx<>The crowd is a lot more mix than other clubs with more asians than other clubs (other than maybe TAO with the older asian crowd)  I hate the fact that they make you buy a bottle of water for 10 dollars rather than just have water cups though.
7610<>xx<>At least there's a fountain so you can refill  Gorgeous Bartenders They serve Henny + 1  Did not run out of towels +1  One line and it was quick with presales.
7611<>xx<>Typical Vegas Drink Prices.
7612<>xx<>Good Ratio compared to the sausage fest at other clubs Not a Sardine can + 1 No Splashing in the pool, (Thank god that shit gets old and annoying quick)
7613<>xx<>Beach pool party for the win during the summer days!
7614<>xx<>You can't go wrong with their pool area here!
7615<>xx<>It is nice and spacious with plenty of people to make it super fun!
7616<>xx<>They have a good dance section on the ground floor and Lil Jon was DJ-ing that day!
7617<>xx<>It was great!
7618<>xx<>There is a podium located in the middle, where you can dance, get cray cray and let loose!
7619<>xx<>Encore, encore, I want me some more!
7620<>xx<>500th review!
7621<>xx<>Wow, I must've come here on the wrong day or maybe left too early.
7622<>xx<>This place was crackin?
7623<>xx<>When I went, this was by far one of the tamer pool parties I've been to in Vegas...which isn't necessarily a bad thing because there's only so much of being on level 10 a girl can take.
7624<>xx<>Interestingly enough, EBC reminds me of a bigger, better Tao Beach...similar music, food, prices and partygoers.
7625<>xx<>My girls and I never pay to get into these pool parties or nightclubs so therefore, even though EBC wasn't really poppin the day we went, there was no love lost.
7626<>xx<>Also, ladies and gents, customary to 99% of pool parties in Vegas, you MUST pay to sit somewhere comfortable and shady.
7627<>xx<>I have a tan year-round so the sun is not somewhere I want to be for very long.
7628<>xx<>That sunburnt look is not cute.
7629<>xx<>Overall I think it's nice, more upscale than most pool parties, and the music is decent.
7630<>xx<>I'll be back.
7631<>xx<>Every time I've come here, with or without a table/lilypad/cabana, I've had a good time.
7632<>xx<>The drinks are great, the music is great (it's EDM) and the people who work there are super nice and even more attractive to look at (hi Evan, Emmanuel, and Giuseppe!).
7633<>xx<>Get yourself on the guestlist or bring enough girls to get in free (and maybe even flirt a lil to get hooked up with a table).
7634<>xx<>They make u check in big bags so keep that in mind and don't bring your entire makeup collection with you.
7635<>xx<>They have lockers (free I believe) for the smaller items you may wanna put away.
7636<>xx<>Towels are provided.
7637<>xx<>There are a few gambling tables too.
7638<>xx<>Tables and lilypads will run u a few bills but expect to drop at least a grand on the cabanas.
7639<>xx<>Personally I like the tables and lilypads more bc they're right in the center of the action.
7640<>xx<>Love this place!
7641<>xx<>Packed, packed, and more packed.
7642<>xx<>I felt like I was in  meat locker with all the dudes around this place.
7643<>xx<>They must have a reverse on the promotion for girls.
7644<>xx<>Must have been dudes no cover and 1 free drink because it was a giant sausage fest.
7645<>xx<>All in all, I ve been here twice (Surrender at night) and it was decent.
7646<>xx<>The only complaint is that it was packed with a lot of dudes.
7647<>xx<>Even though I was there with my girlfriend, I don't want these drunk clowns smashing into me every 5 seconds trying to get to the bar.
7648<>xx<>The drinks are also wayyyy overpriced.
7649<>xx<>$12-20 for mixed drink.
7650<>xx<>Don't know how much beers are, but I can imagine $10 a pop.
7651<>xx<>They should have some local specials  While it was Sunday, this place is still very nice and definitely upscale.
7652<>xx<>Steve Wynn makes a killing off of this place.
7653<>xx<>Next time, I wish it wasn't as packed.
7654<>xx<>I'm not much for pools as some here are just a clusterfuck, but this was open and spacious.
7655<>xx<>Decent sized infinity edge pool with a few waterfall edge jacuzzis off to the side.
7656<>xx<>Nice open layout with two bars, card tables, nice day beds and also covered cabanas spanning the surrounding areas on three floors.The decor is beautifully executed and seems to make sense with the concept of the whole hotel's property.
7657<>xx<>Not feeling Surrender, not really agreeing on its decor matching/meshing with this outdoor area.
7658<>xx<>They're connected- arent they supposed to be coherent?
7659<>xx<>Beach Club I really like and will be back for Steve Aoki on Fridays- of course, I'm going to be outside the whole time.
7660<>xx<>Yeah crowd was very mellow.
7661<>xx<>At least for us, we were mellow more because of the DJ.
7662<>xx<>BF and I sat down to listen and nitpick.
7663<>xx<>If you are music listeners like us and have DJ gear at home, you would see that there was some that was not working nor was the song selection the best in creating a "mood"....it was scattered.
7664<>xx<>There was moments where we liked what we picked, but it was shortlived as something usually, the song choice or mix in that we were not feeling.
7665<>xx<>If you don't get music, ignorance I guess is bliss and go ahead and dance your ass off, but we just can't.
7666<>xx<>We aren't club heads so music better be good.
7667<>xx<>I know Steve Aoki well and if it's one thing that guy does well is create a coherent set and works crowds like no other so the vibe will change once he is here.
7668<>xx<>I know I will be found in the forefront by the DJ booth going apeshit.
7669<>xx<>He's a little dose of home and the club scene in LA I love.
7670<>xx<>Oh and Kasade is the resident for Sunday afternoons.
7671<>xx<>Thats a pretty big lineup they have going here and am excited about.
7672<>xx<>Fuck Paul Oakenfold Perfecto.
7673<>xx<>To be continued I guess....things will be changing once the place is in business and their rightful DJ's take the helm.
7674<>xx<>Hmmm 3 hour line, no joke.
7675<>xx<>We would have skipped if we hadnt had table reservations for sure.
7676<>xx<>They were so sold out, it was insane.
7677<>xx<>And you still have to deal with the graft and hustle when youre spending 2k; it isnt fun or cool, its stressful.
7678<>xx<>The crazy part is that 2k was like chump change compared to what a lot of other people were paying.
7679<>xx<>None the less we came late and still got a decent spot.
7680<>xx<>Service was ridiculously slow, did I mention how insanely sold out they were?
7681<>xx<>Yet Morgan Page turned it all around.
7682<>xx<>World class entertainment in a super intimate 5 feet away from stage and pool, how could you go wrong?
7683<>xx<>It was awesome.
7684<>xx<>Why cant they cool the pool?
7685<>xx<>I dont get that lol
7686<>xx<>Um hot tubs in the cabanas?
7687<>xx<>Deal sealed.
7688<>xx<>Oh and they seem to always get the best DJs.
7689<>xx<>That helps too.
7690<>xx<>My most recent time at EBC over this past weekend was so much fun that it was the highlight of the trip!
7691<>xx<>We walked in around 12:30 and our promoter got us some good comps: immediate entry, daybed and a few pitchers (I have no idea what was in there but it was fruity and delicious).
7692<>xx<>The club itself was doing a open mimosa bar and hello kitty bikini giveaway so that was a nice bonus.
7693<>xx<>My girls and I had a blast dancing to great music, drinking, and playing blackjack at their mini casino!
7694<>xx<>Don't get me wrong, I love this place but a couple things concerned me on this last visit.
7695<>xx<>Security is not as great as you would think.
7696<>xx<>I brought in something very easily and if I can that means everyone else can.
7697<>xx<>Also, I saw a girl slip and fall and hit her head.
7698<>xx<>The staff helped her up but did not really check to make sure she was ok.   Kaskade was amazing so of course I would go back.
7699<>xx<>I love love love this place...
7700<>xx<>It's like a second home lol.
7701<>xx<>Service is always awesome!!!
7702<>xx<>Love their Nutella latte or cappuccino, but all their coffee are better than any.
7703<>xx<>My kids enjoys their mocha choca fluff it's truly made for the lil ones.
7704<>xx<>This is exactly the type of place we need more of in Vegas.
7705<>xx<>Friendly people.
7706<>xx<>Local flavors.
7707<>xx<>Casual and welcoming atmosphere.
7708<>xx<>Dog-friendly too!
7709<>xx<>I bookmarked this place due to all the great reviews.
7710<>xx<>I must thank Chastine V for tempering the hype by providing a not-so-great review.
7711<>xx<>I like to keep my expectations in check when trying a new place.
7712<>xx<>I will admit, I'm really not much of a coffee connoisseur.
7713<>xx<>Then again, I could say that about everything I ever try.
7714<>xx<>I just know what I like.
7715<>xx<>At Sambalatte, everything I've had so far has been to my liking.
7716<>xx<>On my first visit, I had their Chocolate Cappuccino.
7717<>xx<>I enjoyed the chocolate flavor to the last drop, but was disappointed that it didn't come with any coffee art.
7718<>xx<>I got to talking to one of the ladies who works there and she recommended the Flat White, so that's what I tried on my next visit.
7719<>xx<>This time, it came with coffee art!
7720<>xx<>I'm so easy to please.
7721<>xx<>Did I mention that they have board games to play?
7722<>xx<>Nuff said.
7723<>xx<>4 stars.
7724<>xx<>I'm a fan.
7725<>xx<>Sip.
7726<>xx<>Savor.
7727<>xx<>Overcharge??!
7728<>xx<>Let me back up here.
7729<>xx<>Overall, I really like this place.
7730<>xx<>I'm really a fan of the cozy sprawl and the walls are funtastic to look at.
7731<>xx<>Absolutely love the maps.
7732<>xx<>I also am a big, big fan of their coffees ( especially the Ethiopian brew ).
7733<>xx<>I find this place charming and it even has some plug in stations for the Plug in People.
7734<>xx<>And I think it fun to watch the coffee being prepped right in front of you.
7735<>xx<>On the other hand, while you're snaking your way through the line and finally arrive at the pastries, all of which look delightfully sinful, you get to the counter and had better check to make sure you get what you order.
7736<>xx<>We ordered the small cups, and they must have thought us in need of the larger pour, because the large is what we got.
7737<>xx<>And they must be testing the newbs by filling the coffee to the brim where nary a grain of sugar wouldn't cause a spillover and let you walk the slow, spilly sloppy crawl back to your seat hoping you don't dump said cup on some poor unwitting soul in your general path.
7738<>xx<>I say Hah Hah, because THEY have to clean it up and I don't feel bad at all about it.
7739<>xx<>So when you go, and I'm sure you will at least once, have them fill only to the point that milk and sugar can be comfortably added.
7740<>xx<>And check your tab.
7741<>xx<>I didn't and they zinged me.
7742<>xx<>Don't let it happen to you.
7743<>xx<>Sip.
7744<>xx<>Savor.
7745<>xx<>Check your bill.
7746<>xx<>I'm tempted to tell you all that Sambalatte is terrible so that you'll leave it all to me, but that would be almost criminal.
7747<>xx<>This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.
7748<>xx<>Excellent, independent shop with top quality coffee.
7749<>xx<>A real antidote to the cookie cutter, cardboard Starbucks monotony.
7750<>xx<>Sambalatte is just about the only place in the US I've come across that can make an authentic Flat White, a delicious coffee drink popular in Australia and New Zealand.
7751<>xx<>They also have a wide selection of teas and sweetened drinks, though I have not tried these.
7752<>xx<>The service staff are primarily young people and, as some have said, maybe a little bit rough, but I notice it getting better all the time.
7753<>xx<>There is a nice selection of pastries, fruit and meat trays, even a few sandwiches like good-quality ham and brie on crusty bread with champagne mustard.
7754<>xx<>The atmosphere has a cool vibe.
7755<>xx<>There are current magazines from around the country, and newspapers, and free wi-fi.
7756<>xx<>There are two floors of indoor seating and seating outside, too, with free standing heaters for the cooler weather.
7757<>xx<>The owner is almost always on site, which is no doubt, why the quality has remained consistently high on each of my visits.
7758<>xx<>I can recommend Sambalatte highly.
7759<>xx<>Located on the west side of town is a very hip, almost L.A. vibe coffee shop.
7760<>xx<>Great atmosphere for some awesome specialty coffee, teas, & desserts, a place to study (there's free wifi), or a place to socialize.
7761<>xx<>Very friendly owners & staff.
7762<>xx<>My bridesmaid and I went here for some cappuccinos but the machine was down.. all they could offer us was drip coffee or tea.
7763<>xx<>thank goodness they had a great tea selection and a cute patio to enjoy.
7764<>xx<>staff was friendly and recommended the lavender earl grey tea.
7765<>xx<>both of us got that and 3 macaroons each:  I got: Black Currant (yuck), Almond (AMAZING) and Passion Fruit (just ok)  she got: Pistachio (she liked it), Caramel (her fav) and Coconut (close to 1st :) )
7766<>xx<>A cool, trendy place for coffee and pastries.
7767<>xx<>By far the best place for coffee in Las Vegas.
7768<>xx<>No comparison to Starbucks, The Coffee Bean, etc.
7769<>xx<>Located in prestigious Boca Park.
7770<>xx<>If you have a car, its worth the drive.
7771<>xx<>My favorite coffee shop in Vegas for the vibe there.
7772<>xx<>Love the live music every time I've been.
7773<>xx<>Sometimes it can get crowded and I've had to wait for seats.
7774<>xx<>Once I had a MILF snap at me in line because I took more than 2 seconds to decide on which macaron I wanted.
7775<>xx<>She didn't even ask and went right in front of me in line as I was admiring the macarons.
7776<>xx<>Pretty normal for some people from this neighborhood I suppose.
7777<>xx<>The macaron was smooth and a tiny bite of perfection.
7778<>xx<>If you don't mind calories this place is great but it does not have as many sugar free options for tea latte or lattes like its competitors.
7779<>xx<>Can't say enough wonderful things about this place.
7780<>xx<>Wonderful atmosphere.
7781<>xx<>Amazing coffee.
7782<>xx<>Great "treat" drinks (we tried the Nutella latte) and delectable light bites (quiche).
7783<>xx<>The atmosphere reminded me of places I'd frequent in Chicago.
7784<>xx<>I love love love this place.
7785<>xx<>I go to Vegas often for work, and have been eyeing the reviews for awhile.
7786<>xx<>I finally made a trip there during Thanksgiving and I was in love.
7787<>xx<>Their lattes are amazing.
7788<>xx<>The prices are a bit more than your average coffee shop, but the atmosphere, service and quality make it worth it.
7789<>xx<>I enjoyed a biscotti the first time I went and it was freshly baked and delicious.
7790<>xx<>Every time I go to Vegas, I have to go to Sambalatte....even if it is nowhere close to where I am going.
7791<>xx<>The BOMB!!!
7792<>xx<>One of the best fusion spots I've had the pleasure of dining.
7793<>xx<>The tacos, pasta, burritos...it's all good!!
7794<>xx<>!
7795<>xx<>Ok... now to rate this small quaint spot that I can do every now and then.
7796<>xx<>I ordered the fried rice and it was pretty good.
7797<>xx<>A little dry, but the flavor was good.
7798<>xx<>Not my choice of dine-in as it's a little diner-ish to me.
7799<>xx<>Lots of in and out loud traffic, loud tv right about booths.
7800<>xx<>Waitresses a little not presentable.
7801<>xx<>I would change that FAST.
7802<>xx<>Appearance is Everything!
7803<>xx<>A few of the tables had been left dirty, another thing they need to work on.
7804<>xx<>It made the place look shabby and dirty...uncared for.
7805<>xx<>The food here is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!
7806<>xx<>Service, prices & portion size are outstanding!
7807<>xx<>My favorite is the Fusion Bulgogi Tostada, Calamari Tacos & Carne Asada Fries (the best in town) but everything is Good!
7808<>xx<>Talk about flavor & deliciousness!
7809<>xx<>If you want a change from the typical foods, you must go here!
7810<>xx<>I can not stop thinking about this place!
7811<>xx<>Instead of trying to get you to relive my experience I'm just going to give you the reasons why you need to get up and go.
7812<>xx<>1.
7813<>xx<>Check in deals 2.
7814<>xx<>Free chips with salsa and guac 3.
7815<>xx<>Food is awesome (Love the tacos!)
7816<>xx<>4.
7817<>xx<>Cheap!
7818<>xx<>5.
7819<>xx<>Veggie options 6.
7820<>xx<>The lady who owns it is super nice
7821<>xx<>I'm not sure this place is worth a trip off the strip if you're visiting.
7822<>xx<>The idea is novel and sounds great - but the meal was just ok - and with so many great deals and choices around town - it's hard to justify going out of your way to try this place.
7823<>xx<>I actually have a regular korean-mexican spot that I love - and it blows this place away.
7824<>xx<>The staff is super friendly here tho - and that alone deserves an extra star.
7825<>xx<>Whew, let me tell you, if there is an open parking space: 1) park 2) Dash inside 3) get a table!
7826<>xx<>This place is really popular.
7827<>xx<>So unique, too.
7828<>xx<>On the surface, Korean/Mexican/Chinese fusion does not sound like it should work.
7829<>xx<>Well, as you can tell by the reviews & ratings, it does work & work well.
7830<>xx<>Also, come hungry, because the portions are, ahem, large.
7831<>xx<>Cheap, too!
7832<>xx<>Lotsa food & cheap, what every growing boy needs, right?
7833<>xx<>I had a Pork Bulgogi taco & Chicken bulgogi fried rice.
7834<>xx<>The classic, eyes too big for my stomach situation.
7835<>xx<>The taco was tasty & spicy, with a mild sweetness (bulgogi, of course).
7836<>xx<>It was pretty big for a street taco, but, I think that is becoming the trend for street tacos.
7837<>xx<>The chicken fried rice was more than plentiful, with chicken, egg, carrots, peas, & scallions.
7838<>xx<>Some ginger & garlic in there, too I think.
7839<>xx<>Light on the soy sauce which is a welcome change from street corner Chinese fare.
7840<>xx<>The place itself is pretty tight on space & the food takes a bit to prepare, but this is not fast food.
7841<>xx<>If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to drop in & try.
7842<>xx<>Been eating here since July and need to update my review after my dinner here last night.
7843<>xx<>It just gets better with time.
7844<>xx<>By now we've eaten burritos, enchiladas, tacos, nachos (yummmm) and my new favorite - tortas!
7845<>xx<>My torta of choice is loaded with bulgogi, lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado and those little sliced pickled jalapenos on a soft roll with a lil mayo ($5.99).
7846<>xx<>I really don't know how to properly describe the fusion taste - it's just incredibly unique and complex.
7847<>xx<>Komex has just wonderful customer service.
7848<>xx<>When we walked in last night it was packed and there people ahead of us waiting for a table.
7849<>xx<>We were contemplating ordering to go and Linda explained that in the amount of time it would take to make our food a table would open.
7850<>xx<>Well she was correct and within 10 minutes two tables became available and she very speedily took care of us.
7851<>xx<>Oh and their mango passionfruit tea is amazing.
7852<>xx<>It's unsweetened but is actually pretty sweet and satisfying.
7853<>xx<>Just a great value.
7854<>xx<>Good food for a great price with great service.
7855<>xx<>Definitely a "do over"!
7856<>xx<>Went here based on it's high score on Yelp.
7857<>xx<>Pulling into the parking lot I was wondering if we had made the right decision.
7858<>xx<>Let me tell you this place is a diamond in the rough.
7859<>xx<>My wife had the bugogi (sp?)
7860<>xx<>Plate with pork and I had the fusion pork tamales.
7861<>xx<>We also split an order of spam musubi.
7862<>xx<>Everything was excellent.
7863<>xx<>The wait staff was very good as well.
7864<>xx<>We've put this on our "every time we go to Vegas, we gotta go here" list.
7865<>xx<>Yummy, yummy, yummy!
7866<>xx<>I really don't know what the hype is for this ramen place.
7867<>xx<>This is my second time here because I thought I would give this place another try.
7868<>xx<>Perhaps this is the best ramen place in Vegas, but if it is, I feel sad that people who live here haven't truly experienced good ramen.
7869<>xx<>The ramen noodles are overcooked and soggy.
7870<>xx<>The broth does not taste like it has been cooked long enough with pork and chicken.
7871<>xx<>If you like the type of broth that is not super thick though, this type of broth might be for you.
7872<>xx<>Flavors seem to be added in after the fact rather than blended in.
7873<>xx<>Something seems off about the whole ramen experience.
7874<>xx<>I give it 2 stars because this place does try and has decent customer service.
7875<>xx<>Due to all of your rave reviews I was compelled to give this place a try.
7876<>xx<>(I can just hear my dad saying, "if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?
7877<>xx<>If it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)
7878<>xx<>This little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.
7879<>xx<>It modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.
7880<>xx<>As you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.
7881<>xx<>It is a simple small noodle shop fighting the Vegas Heat with a weak AC system and a multitude of fans.
7882<>xx<>Was it warm?
7883<>xx<>Yes sir, very much so.
7884<>xx<>But my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.
7885<>xx<>We sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.
7886<>xx<>Service was immediate and friendly.
7887<>xx<>I found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.
7888<>xx<>I often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if I did not enjoy my meal.
7889<>xx<>Neither would be the case today.
7890<>xx<>I have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.
7891<>xx<>I hoped for a similar experience.
7892<>xx<>I quickly decided on the Tonkotsu Ramen with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and green onions.
7893<>xx<>I noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.
7894<>xx<>Great minds think alike right?
7895<>xx<>A few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.
7896<>xx<>I dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.
7897<>xx<>I love the thinner noodles over udon, so I am a bit biased here.
7898<>xx<>The noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.
7899<>xx<>The Chashu I got was soft and delicious.
7900<>xx<>Everything just seemed to go together perfectly.
7901<>xx<>If I were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.
7902<>xx<>But since I have had some outstanding noodles in California that I set my standards by, I'll give this 4.
7903<>xx<>Don't get me wrong, this place is great, and I will be back, but I am saving the 5 star rating for a place I love in California.
7904<>xx<>I just need to eat there a few more times and make sure that it wasn't just the one time.
7905<>xx<>I'm going to lobby for a bullet train or an underground mine shaft (with pulley cart included) to take me pronto to Monta Noodle House from the strip.
7906<>xx<>This place is popular with the locals and frequent Vegas visitors.
7907<>xx<>The hype is no bull and regrettably if you arrive after 5 pm, there are clusters of hungry ass people waiting for an open seat outside & inside.
7908<>xx<>And dammit, I will wait.
7909<>xx<>You cannot go wrong ordering the shoyu ramen, unless you space and not ask for extra char siu aka "juicy pork butt".
7910<>xx<>To really have a ramen equivalent of the "Calgon-take-me-away" dreaminess, get extra char siu, egg, nori, menma (marinated bamboo shoots).
7911<>xx<>Their broth has been made the traditional way.
7912<>xx<>Really good broth doesn't require lots of salt or shoyu, just enough to enhance its flavor.
7913<>xx<>I rarely finish the broth, since most places make it way too salty but I cleared my bowl here.
7914<>xx<>One tip I will mention is the ramen will come with basic garnish of  green onions.
7915<>xx<>I made the mistake of ordering it as an extra, and I got a mound of jullienne scallions which was a bit onion overkill.
7916<>xx<>Their gyoza is excellent, and compliments a bowl of ramen so don't forget that too.
7917<>xx<>On top of all that yumminess, super cute&sweet servers that are fast on their feet to clear a table so I can devour more ramen when need be.
7918<>xx<>We waited for about 30 minutes which was expected from the reviews on yelp.
7919<>xx<>We got seated at the counter and ordered, small fried rice, small pork belly rice, gyoza, shoyu ramen & tonkotsu shoyu ramen.
7920<>xx<>The gyoza was flavorful and good!
7921<>xx<>The pork belly bowl was ok...
7922<>xx<>But the fried rice and ramen was a complete disappointment!
7923<>xx<>The soup is nothing but BLAND!!!!!
7924<>xx<>:( no richness at all.. Will defiantly not be back
7925<>xx<>I don't have a lot of Ramen expertise but this place far exceeded my expectations, which were high before I walked through the door.
7926<>xx<>An outstanding meal for right around $10.
7927<>xx<>If given the choice of going out to eat vs. staying in, I never even think about where I might want to go, I always go to Monta.
7928<>xx<>A good friend introduced me to this wonderful place a long time ago, and it's been my favorite spot ever since.
7929<>xx<>The quality of food and service is top notch, and they never disappoint.
7930<>xx<>I order the Tonkotsu-Shoyu with extra pork belly and an egg.
7931<>xx<>For such delicious food, the prices are astoundingly good.
7932<>xx<>I honestly could not say enough good things about this place.
7933<>xx<>I've taken numerous people to this place, and will continue to do so.
7934<>xx<>I've told out of town friends, and anyone that has mentioned a hankering for ramen, or food in general, to come here, because they have not lived until they've eaten the best ramen in town.
7935<>xx<>I wish there were more space for seating, but it's not really a problem if I have to wait.
7936<>xx<>The reason there is a wait is because everyone knows how amazing this place is, and their food is well worth the wait.
7937<>xx<>Well worth it.
7938<>xx<>I could have sworn I wrote a review for Monta a long time ago.
7939<>xx<>I would have sworn incorrectly.
7940<>xx<>I think most peoples' initial impression of Monta is "why is there a line outside?"
7941<>xx<>and then they peek in and think, "why didn't they just rent a bigger space?"
7942<>xx<>Luckily, their turnaround time is good.
7943<>xx<>You're usually in with reasonable waiting.
7944<>xx<>It is tiny, though.
7945<>xx<>Be prepared.
7946<>xx<>The ramen itself is just fine.
7947<>xx<>I think I'll call it "starter ramen."
7948<>xx<>It's not special in any category.
7949<>xx<>It's ramen.
7950<>xx<>Its reliable.
7951<>xx<>You can customize it a bit.
7952<>xx<>You can order surprisingly good fried rice!
7953<>xx<>I am a huge fan of the takana variety.
7954<>xx<>I don't know why.
7955<>xx<>I also almost always ask for low sodium in the broth.
7956<>xx<>That's right!
7957<>xx<>It isn't pre-made that way.
7958<>xx<>Everyone, including myself, is often shocked at this.
7959<>xx<>There is a healthy serving of noodles so you're basically guaranteed not to be hungry when you leave.
7960<>xx<>If you are, just get some gyoza and you're set.
7961<>xx<>Nice and crispy.
7962<>xx<>They're not fresh or anything, but they work.
7963<>xx<>Hey, if you're in Henderson, don't even bother.
7964<>xx<>Just go to their new younger brother/sister - Monta Chaya.
7965<>xx<>It's better anyway for shallow reasons.
7966<>xx<>Simple amazing.
7967<>xx<>The noodles here were fantastic with a nice variety of different sauces to completely customize your meal.
7968<>xx<>I had the Shoyu Ramen and it was wonderful.
7969<>xx<>The noodles and pork were fantastic.
7970<>xx<>The broth was also incredibly flavorful with a smoother, milder taste.
7971<>xx<>I tried the tonkatsu broth too which is equally wonderful but in a more milky, slightly heavier way.
7972<>xx<>The gyoza was also great especially paired with some of the sauces.
7973<>xx<>This was definitely one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.
7974<>xx<>The fact that I was hungover and had spent the morning in the desert only added to the greatness.
7975<>xx<>The place had a very nice, and subtle ambiance.
7976<>xx<>The place was clean, the decorations were very simple but had personality and the place drew a nice crowd that was more than just the tourists that clog the Strip.
7977<>xx<>The wait staff was also incredibly helpful, efficient, and friendly.
7978<>xx<>I liked that when my table ordered the gyoza they said it would be ready in seven minutes.
7979<>xx<>Now that's service!
7980<>xx<>Oh, and they have A/C now.
7981<>xx<>so your desert heat fears can be alleviated.
7982<>xx<>If you're in Vegas and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip and also want some great Ramen this is the place to go.
7983<>xx<>I definitely recommend going.
7984<>xx<>Also, great hangover food.
7985<>xx<>The tonkotsu-shoryu ramen with green onion, corn & chashu works wonders.
7986<>xx<>The soup was just a tad bit salty for my liking, but the meal & service made up for the tiny flaw.
7987<>xx<>Good food & service for around $10 is definitely a Winner-Winner, Monta Ramen Dinner!
7988<>xx<>If you have ever had ramen in So Cal (Santouka and Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata for example), you'd know this place does not measure up at all.
7989<>xx<>My Miso Ramen was thick and salty.
7990<>xx<>It was more like gravy than soup.
7991<>xx<>My fiance's Gyoza tasted like they were bought from the asian supermarket.
7992<>xx<>While the botton was cooked, the top was still cold.
7993<>xx<>Bad choice for dinner.
7994<>xx<>The restaurant had tinted windows so it isn't as inviting as other Vietnamese restaurants around the area but because of the good ratings we decided to give it a try.
7995<>xx<>We tried the pho dac biet and bun bo hue and they were both good!
7996<>xx<>The service was excellent, we were greeted as we walked in, checked on during the meal n thanked as we walked out.
7997<>xx<>We'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves tasty n authentic Vietnamese food!
7998<>xx<>Yum Yum
7999<>xx<>Friends from out of town were hankering for Vietnamese and we chose this place based on the mostly 4 star reviews and the free egg rolls with the Yelp check in.
8000<>xx<>It has probably been a good two years since I had pho.
8001<>xx<>That's weird for me to say or even fathom but hitting up all the places I have bookmarked ain't easy.
8002<>xx<>My wife got the rare beef pho which she said was the best pho she's had in LV.
8003<>xx<>I didn't even have a shot at trying it since she scarfed it down so quick.
8004<>xx<>I went out of the box and got the curry pho which was filled with veggies and dark meat chicken on the bone.
8005<>xx<>I really liked the flavor and you could tell this broth had been simmering for quite some time.
8006<>xx<>Misti Y's review of Kinh Do was the one that stood out while deciding which pho spot to choose.
8007<>xx<>Lo and behold..who do we run into there but Misti and Bobby Y!!
8008<>xx<>I didn't notice her review was 2 years old but we still liked it a lot and definitely plan on getting our next phix of pho here!
8009<>xx<>Came in for lunch and tried the Bun Bo Hue.
8010<>xx<>The  free wifi here is a nice feature and the ingredients to put inside your BBH were fresh.
8011<>xx<>As for the flavor of my BBH it was good although the quantity of meat could have been more generous.
8012<>xx<>I really liked the fact that I was able to get some work done here and they didn't rush me off at all.
8013<>xx<>The owners are both really friendly here and they do accept credit cards.
8014<>xx<>hurting after a long night, so we decided on some Pho for lunch.
8015<>xx<>it was just the closet to where we were staying, so we hit it up.
8016<>xx<>The was pho was pretty good.
8017<>xx<>i just got the reg combo pho.
8018<>xx<>can't go wrong with it.
8019<>xx<>ordered a grilled pork sandwich for later, pretty good,(great call be me).
8020<>xx<>Checked in on yelp and there was a free 2 eggrolls!
8021<>xx<>come up!
8022<>xx<>and the server was like oh i got you i'll bring some out for everyone!
8023<>xx<>Service was on point, took care of us like some VIP's.
8024<>xx<>Ordered a bunch of pho and sandwiches to go and they got it all together and ready to go when we were done eating, perfect timing.
8025<>xx<>All in all good food and great service.
8026<>xx<>The place was basically eh... Wouldn't really go back unless it was the ONLY place open.
8027<>xx<>I forgot what I got but if I don't remember, that means it wasn't that great.
8028<>xx<>Since  my friends and I checked in, we were suppose to each get 2 egg rolls but they said that they would just give everyone one (which was ok but it seemed that the egg roll was better then the food).
8029<>xx<>Overall.. server was nice but food not so much.
8030<>xx<>Really good to eat.
8031<>xx<>When in Vegas I'll be back.
8032<>xx<>Service excellent!
8033<>xx<>THE ONLY PLACE TO COME FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS!
8034<>xx<>Let me start off by saying I have tried so many other Pho places here in Las Vegas.
8035<>xx<>I have finally found the one I have been searching for over 5 years now.
8036<>xx<>My search for the perfect bowl of Pho is OVER!
8037<>xx<>When it comes to a good bowl of Pho, it is a combination of things - broth, noodles & meat.
8038<>xx<>Their broth is best in town, hands down!
8039<>xx<>The noodles are always cooked perfectly.
8040<>xx<>When I order the Pho I always get the special combination and the meat is always in good portion.
8041<>xx<>Their beef meatballs are always tender, well cooked and don't have that rubbery taste-smell that other places have.
8042<>xx<>The well done meat is meaty and not just fatty.
8043<>xx<>And we all know how at some Pho places, your meat will have the tinge of silver, purple metallic to it (because it's old).
8044<>xx<>This place never does!
8045<>xx<>There have never been problems with customizing how I want my pho either.
8046<>xx<>My husband prefers his with no tripe and extra tendon.
8047<>xx<>When you ask for extra tendon they really give it to you.
8048<>xx<>I have unfortunately experience many places where you ask for extra tendon or meat and they charge you for it but don't really give you extra.
8049<>xx<>To be honest, i dont think they have ever charged me for extra tendon either.
8050<>xx<>I have also tried their udon soup with pork hock and shrimp.
8051<>xx<>I am not sure if their is a difference between Vietnamese udon and Japanese udon but theirs is phenomenal.
8052<>xx<>The noodles are soft and squishy but yet have a firm bite to them.
8053<>xx<>My only sadness about this soup was that I wished it had more pork hock in it, they only gave me one piece.
8054<>xx<>Plenty of shrimp, ground pork and pork slices to make up for it though.
8055<>xx<>The bun rieu is another of my fave's as well.
8056<>xx<>The broth is spicy and delicious and ingredients plentiful.
8057<>xx<>Their fresh spring rolls are always made fresh.
8058<>xx<>Unlike other places that often premake their rolls.
8059<>xx<>The bahn mi's are pretty good but with only an okay selection.
8060<>xx<>The waitress is Vietnamese and her English is limited but every time I come in, her English is getting better and she has never messed up my meal.
8061<>xx<>She is one of the most polite, friendliest servers I have ever in my life had the pleasure of having.
8062<>xx<>So even with the language barrier, she is still better than plenty of English speaking ones I have had.
8063<>xx<>One of the nice perks of this Pho place is that they offer you Hot or Cold Jasmine Tea instead of just water.
8064<>xx<>Another thing I look for in a good Pho place is the cleanliness.
8065<>xx<>Not just the restaurant itself but in the provided utensils.
8066<>xx<>At some places, their spoons and items are dingy and old looking.
8067<>xx<>Another positive for me, theirs always have that brand new look to it.
8068<>xx<>On top of it, it is authentic.
8069<>xx<>The cook in the back is a Vietnamese lady, not hired Hispanics to cook the food.
8070<>xx<>(No offense to hispanic cooks) A plus in my book.
8071<>xx<>And the owner is friendly and down to earth.
8072<>xx<>I go to this place at least every other week.
8073<>xx<>It is that Killer.
8074<>xx<>Once you try it, you will never go anywhere else.
8075<>xx<>Nothing special.
8076<>xx<>I felt the egg rolls were greasy but it still had good flavors going on.
8077<>xx<>The broth was very good and Sriracha that i added have it the kick it needed.
8078<>xx<>I would have loved more veggies and jalapeños and even asked for them when I ordered but sadly no extra veggies!
8079<>xx<>The waitress was on top of it and very friendly.
8080<>xx<>Where the original Pho Nhu Y stands across the street from Ichiza, we have the name that brings a smile to your face when you see the sign.
8081<>xx<>A new place that took over a Vietnamese restaurant 3 months ago.
8082<>xx<>I went with the combination Pho with the rare slice beef, well done flak Tendon, trip, beef balls, and brisket.
8083<>xx<>The broth was delicious with a strong taste like Pho Vilage.
8084<>xx<>One major issue with the broth was it was really was yellow.
8085<>xx<>The only way to get a yellow broth like this is to use chicken or have a lot of fat in it.
8086<>xx<>Since this is beef noodle soup, I'll say its the latter.
8087<>xx<>Don't get me wrong, I love fat but this broth was really yellow.
8088<>xx<>It made me felt I was drinking a bowl of oil.
8089<>xx<>Unlike other places, they don't scoop out the fat.
8090<>xx<>I talked to the owner about it and she says to request the fat be scooped out next time.
8091<>xx<>Personally, I think this should be standard and I shouldn't have to ask for it.
8092<>xx<>She also made the remark that all this fat gives the pho its flavor.
8093<>xx<>Right.
8094<>xx<>Adding fat to anything would make it taste better!
8095<>xx<>The noodles aren't anything special.
8096<>xx<>This has the same blandness as all the other places in town, except for Pho 87 and Pho Village.
8097<>xx<>I was happy to see this Vietnamese restaurant use the culantro, the pointed fregrancy smelling vegetable.
8098<>xx<>Only downer was one of the 3 leaves were wilted.
8099<>xx<>The basil were wilted as well.
8100<>xx<>The bean sprouts looked fine though.
8101<>xx<>For a Vietnamese restaurant at the heart of Chinatown, I was surprised how nice and clean the place was.
8102<>xx<>A good size HDTV sits on the side of the restaurant.
8103<>xx<>Service was meh, like a fast food place.
8104<>xx<>I order.
8105<>xx<>I eat.
8106<>xx<>I pay.
8107<>xx<>I'm out.
8108<>xx<>I did get ice tea instead of water.
8109<>xx<>Nice in this 110 degree weather with stupid rain.
8110<>xx<>They do take credit cards.
8111<>xx<>They have free wifi, or someone nearby with the network ssid "dlink"  Some other stuff they have is spring rolls, nem nuong (pork rolls), goi ga (egg rolls), banh xeo (pancake), com (broken rice), bunh bo hu (vermicelli noodle), and banh mi (sandwhich).
8112<>xx<>Literally all the stuff you find at most Chinese restaurant.
8113<>xx<>Not a bad place for a Vietnamese restaurant thats closer to the heart of Chinatown.
8114<>xx<>There are issues with the pho, but otherwise delicious.
8115<>xx<>A place worth trying.
8116<>xx<>Best broth I have tasted in town, the staff was very friendly.
8117<>xx<>I had the combination Pho and it was heaven.
8118<>xx<>This will be my go to spot in town from now on.
8119<>xx<>I had the opportunity to eat at this place.
8120<>xx<>My coworker gave me a coupon and another coworker and I, went there for lunch.
8121<>xx<>The strips can be ordered fried, baked or grilled.
8122<>xx<>You have a choice of sides, fires, mac and cheese or grilled vegetables.
8123<>xx<>They have one of the mega selection soda machines, which I like, better than the burger kings, with the same machines, which doesn't have the add-on flavorings like cherry.
8124<>xx<>( To be fair, the burger king I was in, was the first time I saw this mega machine, the other locations may keep their's stocked)  We both had the four strips fried, with mac and cheese.
8125<>xx<>The mac and cheese was great, I saw the person at the next table was having the grilled vegetables, they looked great, I asked, he said they were excellent.
8126<>xx<>I will definitely have to try them.
8127<>xx<>First time there, I didn't know.
8128<>xx<>They have a large selection of dipping sauces, buffalo, ranch, teriyaki, wasabi cream, sweet chili, bbq, honey mustard, bfg (think Cane's) and cheese.
8129<>xx<>Now to the strips.
8130<>xx<>I don't understand this, I had 4 strips, two were perfect, two were rubbery.
8131<>xx<>I got the impression they cooked them when you order them, I still have that impression.
8132<>xx<>The strips were the same size, how can they come out different.
8133<>xx<>If I had four of the of the perfect strips, I would have given a 4. if I had four of the rubbery ones, I would have given a 1.
8134<>xx<>I gave a 3 because of the mac and cheese was great, two of the strips were good and the soda mach was fully stocked.
8135<>xx<>I will try it again, in hopes of getting 4 good strips.
8136<>xx<>The owners are nice, almost a little TOO nice.
8137<>xx<>The chicken is good I got the fried and baked versions and I liked the fried better.
8138<>xx<>Mac and cheese I was not blown away.
8139<>xx<>It was cheesy and hot but it lacked flavor!
8140<>xx<>My biggest gripe is those sauce cups I mean really they are 1 oz cups and are not even full.
8141<>xx<>I use 1 cup per chicken strip at least.
8142<>xx<>I asked for more sauce and they are 40 cents for 1 oz of sauce.
8143<>xx<>Wing stop has better wings and fries and more sauce.
8144<>xx<>Their 4 oz sauce cups are 50 cents thanks
8145<>xx<>outstanding second visit as good as 1st time excellent food great chicken strips people are so nice  would go again and again will tell everybody although they need a biger combo than 4 piece maybe a ten piece please
8146<>xx<>I know- how many flippin' review updates am I gonna do?!
8147<>xx<>But it's a BFG first (I think) to have a fan family.
8148<>xx<>It's already known the BF and I already love this place but we brought mom and grandma so their opinion matters.....the place is mom and grandma approved!
8149<>xx<>My mom in law likes their mac n cheese a lot and for a person who doesn't like chicken, admits this is pretty good chicken.
8150<>xx<>Grandma has been wanting chicken strips and she loved it.
8151<>xx<>She's already talking about coming back.
8152<>xx<>We also shared the chicken nachos so I'm 2 of 4 on the specials.
8153<>xx<>Pretty good and a decent portion for $3.25.
8154<>xx<>We all had a plate so we were sttuuuuffffeeeddd, but Jin totally pulled my leg to get it (thanks- I will get it again).
8155<>xx<>The chicken strip phenomenon still perplexes me- so simple but it's crazy how much people it attracts.
8156<>xx<>I love it so I am not complaining.
8157<>xx<>Now I'm keeping an eye on Tin because there has to be some magical voodoo dust in the panko.
8158<>xx<>I have not met a person with bad things to say about BFG yet I've met people who will talk shit even about Joel Robuchons food.
8159<>xx<>One of my friends from Los Angeles knows about BFG and I wasn't the one who told them...seems like the chicken did more than cross the road.
8160<>xx<>Vegas now and onto west coast domination?
8161<>xx<>I first visited this restaurant back in 2011 (as BFG) when Yelpers all over Vegas were fawning over it.
8162<>xx<>Not only was the food raved about but everyone seemed amazed at how well the owner at the time could remember names to faces and naturally I wanted to test it out.
8163<>xx<>True story: the 2nd time I went back he had no idea who I was.
8164<>xx<>Nice parlor trick!
8165<>xx<>The fact that it's extremely close to my work didn't hurt either.
8166<>xx<>As of a few weeks ago I visited it again for the 4th time (the 2nd time under the new monikor).
8167<>xx<>I feel like that fact pretty much exemplifies how I feel about about it.
8168<>xx<>If I hated it, I probably would have never returned.
8169<>xx<>If I loved it, I'd probably have been 15-20 times at least.
8170<>xx<>Yelp math!
8171<>xx<>In those 4 visits I have tried all 3 variations of their signature chicken strips, and the grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and fries for sides.
8172<>xx<>Grilled:  This is what I was most excited about.
8173<>xx<>Every so and so months I decide that I need to stop gorging myself on red meat and carbs as I usually do, so reading about tasty grilled chicken strips accompanied by grilled veggies made my deep deep inner skinny person rejoice.
8174<>xx<>Unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed both times I tried them.
8175<>xx<>The chicken and the veggies both just tasted very bland to me.
8176<>xx<>Maybe every delicious fried chicken finger I've had from Raising Cane's and other establishments has tainted my taste buds.
8177<>xx<>Baked:  Tried this for the first time a few weeks back.
8178<>xx<>Better than the grilled for sure due to the seasoning, but not anything that has me craving a return visit.
8179<>xx<>With this order I had the fries, which I did enjoy quite a bit.
8180<>xx<>But I mean, they're FRIES.
8181<>xx<>Hot, crispy and well seasoned though.
8182<>xx<>Fried:  The best of the three, but to reiterate the point: it's fried chicken, of course it's good.
8183<>xx<>The panko breading definitely make it unique to most other versions you can find elsewhere, but not necessarily better tastewise.
8184<>xx<>And to make an unhealthy choice worse I got the mac and cheese with it the one time I tried it.
8185<>xx<>A good version for sure, but it didn't exactly set itself apart from most other mac and cheeses that I've had.
8186<>xx<>The stars of the show here are the dipping sauces.
8187<>xx<>The wide variety of them provide for a lot of different tasting experiences and most of the ones I tried were extremely tasty.
8188<>xx<>My favorites are the sweet chili and wasabi cream, and in particular I liked combining those two for a sweet/spicy combo.
8189<>xx<>You can be like Bill Nye the Science Guy and experiment on your own combinations.
8190<>xx<>Bring the kids, they'll have a blast.
8191<>xx<>So overall it's good food, and the price isn't too bad, but it doesn't exactly light my world on fire either.
8192<>xx<>See you in 8 months or so Strip N Dip!
8193<>xx<>Five stars for the baked mac and cheese and wasabi cream alone.
8194<>xx<>Everything else is good, as well.
8195<>xx<>Get ready, Vegas!
8196<>xx<>Your taste buds are going to thank you.
8197<>xx<>Whether you prefer your chicken baked, fried or grilled, you can't go wrong!
8198<>xx<>I prefer the fried variety.
8199<>xx<>Juicy, flavorful tender strips lightly battered and sooo crispy!
8200<>xx<>They have a huge selection of sauces for any taste.
8201<>xx<>I like the house sauce myself.
8202<>xx<>Add to that crispy golden fries and a slice of garlic toast.
8203<>xx<>Nomnom!
8204<>xx<>The owners are friendly and real pros with chicken flavor!
8205<>xx<>These guys rock!
8206<>xx<>Plus I'm lucky to have my Sign-A-Rama shop only a couple doors down from them (shamelss self-promotion).
8207<>xx<>The grilled strips are also A plus.
8208<>xx<>Tasty and a healty alternative to the fried variety.
8209<>xx<>Bring the gang and chow down on some good stuff.
8210<>xx<>Better than any chain chicken in the world.
8211<>xx<>5 stars.
8212<>xx<>KF WHO???
8213<>xx<>?
8214<>xx<>Dood...
8215<>xx<>The bestest chicken strips in Vegas, forget about the rest!
8216<>xx<>The buck stops here, o sooooo tender n juicy inside, crispity, scrunchity outside with the Panko flakes.
8217<>xx<>The fries are goo too!
8218<>xx<>Mac n cheese a bit too cheesy for me but if you like cheese u will luv it!
8219<>xx<>3 ways to get em folks.....  B aked F ried G rilled  Grilled veggies are delicious, yummmm  They have weekly specials also: Watch for the hot chick $2 not gonna find that deal at the local stripclub....   Chicken nachos?
8220<>xx<>U guys r killin me....  Why do you do it, BFG?!
8221<>xx<>?
8222<>xx<>Delicious food and friendly service, the same as when it was BFG.
8223<>xx<>The only real difference I can spot is that we no longer can get those awesome weekly specials.
8224<>xx<>:( They also now have a points based rewards program to earn free meals.
8225<>xx<>This place is awesome...It is located next to The Home Depot on Rainbow bet.
8226<>xx<>Alta and Charleston.
8227<>xx<>By far the best chicken strips around.
8228<>xx<>Raising Cane..bah bye...BFG blows you away.
8229<>xx<>Not only are the chicken strips perfect (any way you order them...baked, fried or grilled) but they have the best mac and cheese and a ridiculous choice of dipping sauces...the two signature sauces are BFG and the wasabi cream (my fav)...this stuff has to bottled it is so good.
8230<>xx<>My husband and I just went back tonight after about a month or two and found out that "The Hot Chick" is  back on the menu...permanently.
8231<>xx<>This is a must have...presented like a hot dog (hence the name)...but sooo much better.
8232<>xx<>Do yourself a big favor...run don't walk to this place...you will not be disappointed...not with the food...not on the customer service...all top notch all the way.
8233<>xx<>In reading the reviews a guy wrote exaclty what I was going to right.
8234<>xx<>THE BEST TACO PLACE IN VEGAS.
8235<>xx<>THE ONLY PLACE BETTER IS GOING TO MEXICO!!!!
8236<>xx<>I discovered this place on Saturday and I have been there 3 times already (it's only Tuesday).
8237<>xx<>I drove from my job at Town Square to the one behind Encore just to have lunch.
8238<>xx<>Took 3 co-workers with me and they all agree.
8239<>xx<>You can bring your own beer.
8240<>xx<>They dont sell beer.
8241<>xx<>Security will simply hand you a brown bag for your drink!
8242<>xx<>The only thing missing is a big pot of home made beans.
8243<>xx<>Went back and along with the spicy pork had some of the beef stomach tacos.
8244<>xx<>I like the pork better but the stomach was solid.
8245<>xx<>This place just hits a home run every time.
8246<>xx<>Was told by the nice cashier they are going to be opening up a location at the strip mall right next to encore.
8247<>xx<>It's on the Strip and just past Encore coming from Venetian, Bellagio, etc.
8248<>xx<>heading towards Stratosphere.
8249<>xx<>Good  times.
8250<>xx<>I tried going to other taco places to search for the best, but I just keep coming back here.
8251<>xx<>If In N Out is to burgers then Tacos El Gordo is the champion of all taquerias in LV.
8252<>xx<>Simple, delicious, no-frills menu.
8253<>xx<>You can't get better than this.
8254<>xx<>Since my last review I've been here numerous times and I always order the same thing: CABEZA, ADOBADA, and LENGUA.
8255<>xx<>If you have not tried these yet, please, step away from your carne asada and discover the sheer pleasure of these juicy, flavorful meats.
8256<>xx<>Out of this world delicious!!
8257<>xx<>!
8258<>xx<>Great place, Really enjoyed the food hear the place is packed but the Waite is well  worth it.
8259<>xx<>the food is so authentic and good for sure the best tacos in Vegas!
8260<>xx<>i am defiantly coming back and bringing the fam.
8261<>xx<>Tacos El Pastor!!!
8262<>xx<>Cheap, Open late, FAST, When we live in town we would go at least once a week!
8263<>xx<>Ok I went based on yelp reviews.
8264<>xx<>Interesting place tacos were very good but small don't let that cheap price fool you.
8265<>xx<>Very casual.
8266<>xx<>For what it is I guess it is ok.  To me unexciting.
8267<>xx<>2 Asian girls and 1 white guy...that was my first thought walking into the door of tacos el gordo.
8268<>xx<>I've never felt so out of place before, as we were the only non Mexicans there, but everyone was super nice.
8269<>xx<>The adobada guy even offered us a sample slice.
8270<>xx<>It reminded me a little of Korean spicy pork.
8271<>xx<>I went with an adobada taco, carne asada taco and chorizo sope.
8272<>xx<>There was an assembly line with the first woman making tortillas by hand.
8273<>xx<>The adobada was everything the yelpers said it was!
8274<>xx<>Spicy, a bit of crispy, and not much fat.
8275<>xx<>I definitely want to get adobada fries next time.
8276<>xx<>Carne asada was ok, but not my fav.
8277<>xx<>It was thinly sliced vs chopped like most Mexican places.
8278<>xx<>It was nice and tender with good flavor, which was ruined by the awful pasty guacamole it automatically was topped with.
8279<>xx<>The guac was pretty damn bad.
8280<>xx<>Chorizo sope was good, the least greasy chorizo I've ever had with  Mexican white cheese melted on top.
8281<>xx<>The texture was almost like a good mozzarella.
8282<>xx<>I've had better sopes, BUT I've also had worse :) Neighborhood was way sketchy, but Tacos el gordo was very clean, they had 2 ladies there just bussing the tables so there's quick turn over.
8283<>xx<>Parking lot was well lit so I felt pretty safe there.
8284<>xx<>It was great Mexican but I probably would only go back if I was in the general area.
8285<>xx<>We got stuck in traffic for electric Daisy so it was over a half hour drive from my side of town.
8286<>xx<>I've been here twice and both times loved the place.
8287<>xx<>It's a bit small and looks like it was either an old Wendy's or Carl's Jr. that was closed down and rebuilt into Tacos El Gordo, so the seating areas are that of a typical fast food restaurant.
8288<>xx<>However, the food there is pretty good.
8289<>xx<>It's one of the best taco places I've been to yet and it's decently priced.
8290<>xx<>I believe it was a little over $2 for majority of the tacos, I personally liked any of the steak/beef ones as I do not eat pork, but from what my friend told me the spicy pork is definitely one to try.
8291<>xx<>The Adobada fries are definitely something everyone should try when they first visit or never had it.
8292<>xx<>It's actually really good.
8293<>xx<>But if you're not with anyone or want to have tacos and the fries, I do however suggest getting the half order.
8294<>xx<>The full order is about $10 but it is something that is either a meal itself or needs to be shared with at least 2+, otherwise you'll have leftovers to take home or a very full stomach!
8295<>xx<>Tacos are just as great as the strip location.
8296<>xx<>But be ready for a wait during peak hours.
8297<>xx<>Hi Tacos el Gordo!
8298<>xx<>Just wanted to let you know that the only reason we came to you for tacos (and knew what to do/to get/how to order)were the reviews you got on Yelp...to think we could have driven by and scoffed at your establishment like the gringos we are!!
8299<>xx<>Everything is so freaking good...the adobado is like crack, the grilled onions and peppers great additions to the best fresh tortillas we've ever had.
8300<>xx<>If there were more than 5 stars avail we'd give it to you BUT for the decor, smell, and overall chaos inside this kinda-shady location off the strip.
8301<>xx<>Seriously, TEG, clean up your act a bit (place smells a bit like a latrine, no clear lines for food unless you are "in the know" and are prepared to eat whatever is handed to you wherever you end up at the grill, and we're not certain if there was carne asada or dirt on the floor everywhere)...clean it up just a smidge and you would be millionaires by months end by our visits alone.
8302<>xx<>Mucho besos, Us
8303<>xx<>Yay my search for the best breakfast place has ended, but doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying other places.
8304<>xx<>Babycakes has all the above...great service, clean, great selection of food, and location is not bad.
8305<>xx<>My sister and I went here on a Friday morning (10ish), wait time was 15 minutes (not too bad).
8306<>xx<>I heard on the weekends it get really packed which I could imagine since the place is pretty small.
8307<>xx<>So we ordered the Rick's adobo fried rice and a short stack of red velvet pancakes.
8308<>xx<>The fried rice was mMmMm yummy and as for the red velvet pancakes OMG worth it.
8309<>xx<>I am definitely going to come here again and try the many different kinds of pancakes they have and other things on the menu.
8310<>xx<>Not sure to give this a 4 star or just a 3...... After driving 15 min from the strip and being told of a 45 min wait we decided to wait.
8311<>xx<>After watching tables staying open for over 20 min I asked why no one was being seated and they told me they have 2 large groups they were saving them for so they could push them together.
8312<>xx<>15 min later they were able to seat the first group of 10  This place is just way too small for groups!
8313<>xx<>I would suggest having one area for groups if any.
8314<>xx<>Our wait turned out to be over an hour!
8315<>xx<>I watched several people walk in and back out.
8316<>xx<>I will say the food is very good!
8317<>xx<>LOVED the Red Velvet pancakes....just not sure the wait was worth it!
8318<>xx<>Try the velvet pancakes is so delicious!
8319<>xx<>Small place but clean.
8320<>xx<>Good service!
8321<>xx<>awesome breakfast place!
8322<>xx<>i heard a LOT of good things about babycakes...mostly the red velvet pancakes.
8323<>xx<>I LOVE red velvet anything so after hearing about them i had to come and try them.
8324<>xx<>the pancakes did not disappoint!
8325<>xx<>SO GOOD!
8326<>xx<>they are a bit sweet so eating an entire order yourself is probably not a good idea.
8327<>xx<>=P my friends and i order a full stack of the pancakes to share and then each got something else.
8328<>xx<>i ordered the kalua pig benedict...i had to try it after reading about it on yelp.
8329<>xx<>it was good.
8330<>xx<>there needed to be a bit more flavor to the pig but overall it was tasty.
8331<>xx<>the potatoes that came with the dish were awesome!
8332<>xx<>perfectly salted and not greasy like a lot of breakfast places.
8333<>xx<>my friends ordered the adobo fried rice and the breakfast burrito with a side of garlic fried rice.
8334<>xx<>the adobe fried rice was delicious...a tad salty but good.
8335<>xx<>i didn't try the burrito but had some of the garlic fried rice and that was good too.
8336<>xx<>don't think i would get a side of it...it had a bit too much onions in it.
8337<>xx<>service was great.
8338<>xx<>there is a bit of a wait on the weekends but totally worth it.
8339<>xx<>i can't wait to come back!
8340<>xx<>=)
8341<>xx<>DELICIOUS!!!
8342<>xx<>The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the wait stinks!!!
8343<>xx<>I don't know if I would wait more than an hour but I must admit the food is delicious and once seated the kitchen gets your food out quick!
8344<>xx<>We went for breakfast and we ordered 2 entrees and then got a side of pancakes.
8345<>xx<>I got the Portugese sausage with 2 eggs and rice with a side of red velvet pancakes.
8346<>xx<>Hubby got 2 scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes with a side of strawberry pancakes.
8347<>xx<>The sausage was to die for and so were the pancakes.
8348<>xx<>I brought home my extra pancake so I could have it for dessert!!!
8349<>xx<>The rice was a bit of a disappointment as it was a little dry and hard.
8350<>xx<>Potatoes also just ok.
8351<>xx<>The bacon was nice and thick and they did the eggs just right.
8352<>xx<>I'm looking forward to going back...
8353<>xx<>There is much more on this menu that I am looking forward to trying.
8354<>xx<>My girlfriend and I gave this place a try last weekend after hiking in the Red Rock Canyons.
8355<>xx<>We have been trying to eat somewhat healthy, and this showed up under a search for 'healthy breakfast' haha well after reading about red velvet pancakes, all bets were off.
8356<>xx<>We turned on the GPS and headed over.
8357<>xx<>We waited for quite awhile, probably a half hour or so, because of the fact that it was Saturday at around 11:30.
8358<>xx<>We really hit the rush because right when we sat down, like four or five tables got up and they didn't get re-seated (do we stink or something!?)
8359<>xx<>The menu looked INCREDIBLE.
8360<>xx<>Banana cream pie pancakes, carrot cake pancakes, orange creamsicle pancakes, SMORES pancakes, and I believe cookies and cream pancakes (there were plenty others but these stuck out to me).
8361<>xx<>We had choice overload, because every single one sounded unbelievable.
8362<>xx<>Since we also read about the homemade corned beef hash, I also wanted to try that.
8363<>xx<>We ended up getting the meal that comes with eggs, corned beef hash, and a couple of pancakes, and ordering a separate short stack as well.
8364<>xx<>We got the short stack of red velvet, and the other 2 were banana cream pie.
8365<>xx<>Well, first, the corned beef hash was FANTASTIC.
8366<>xx<>I would come back just to have that for breakfast again.
8367<>xx<>For some reason I was craving it, and man did it hit the spot.
8368<>xx<>The red velvet pancakes were probably the best I ever had, and mostly because of the creamcheese sauce they put on top.
8369<>xx<>If I wasn't 'eating healthy' I would have asked for some extra, because that would have made it the best thing in the whole world.
8370<>xx<>The banana cream pie ones were also really good, but my girlfriend felt they tasted a bit too artificial.
8371<>xx<>I personally really liked them.
8372<>xx<>The bill was something like 20 bucks, and for 2 people including coffees, we were more than happy with that.
8373<>xx<>The two woman that were at the front were also really friendly, and chatted with us about our experience afterwards.
8374<>xx<>Great value, great breakfast, and incredible pancakes.
8375<>xx<>Will definitely be back again.
8376<>xx<>Was in the area, so I decided to stop by and try this new place.
8377<>xx<>It was pretty busy at around 1:30PM.
8378<>xx<>The red velvet pancake is good but the other local hawaiian food isn't that great.
8379<>xx<>Worth a try if you're into fancy pancakes.
8380<>xx<>Overall experience was ok.  Kind of a little pricey I think.
8381<>xx<>Okay.
8382<>xx<>Not so great as everyone states.
8383<>xx<>I though the Huevos rancheros were so so.
8384<>xx<>The chicken was cubed and took away.
8385<>xx<>The tortillas were not fried before hand.
8386<>xx<>I think egg and I is better.
8387<>xx<>HOWEVER, if you like Hawaiian breakfast, then I would recommend you go.
8388<>xx<>the pork was good.
8389<>xx<>order it.
8390<>xx<>Cute place to go in the morning to meet a friend or two.
8391<>xx<>The service is average and food is tasty.
8392<>xx<>The wait can be ridiculous, but you don't go there because you are short on time.
8393<>xx<>You have a very open choice of pancakes and other breakfast fare.
8394<>xx<>First visit this past Saturday.
8395<>xx<>7 pm, no tables available til 8:15 so... we were offered a place at the community table or at the bar - we chose the bar as there were 3 seats together.
8396<>xx<>It was a perfect choice.
8397<>xx<>Very personal service, some good conversation and excellent food and wine.
8398<>xx<>3 of us had 3 different entrees and each one was perfect.
8399<>xx<>Shrimp with andoille(sp) sausage, Pork Chop and Shepherds Pie.
8400<>xx<>Fox Valley Pino Gris wine!.
8401<>xx<>My spelling may not be up to par but believe me - your visit will be.
8402<>xx<>We met the Chef's wife and she was as charming as the restaurant.
8403<>xx<>Very nice place, sensibly priced and worth a visit - or visits.
8404<>xx<>Another fantastic Yelp find!
8405<>xx<>Beckett's Table was different right away, as soon as my group of eight sat down our waitress told us to relax, take our time, choose carefully and ask all the questions we wanted.
8406<>xx<>You could tell she wanted us to have a great time, she had no desire to rush us and fit in another group, it was refreshing.
8407<>xx<>Beckett's Table is elegant in a simple way if that makes sense, it's not super dim lighting with expensive leather everywhere, it's lots of wood with an exposed ceiling, but still, the decorations with the big windows and warm color scheme mix perfectly and light the room up.
8408<>xx<>Appetizers are king here.
8409<>xx<>The entrees are good, and I'll get to them, but they are a shadow compared to the starters.
8410<>xx<>I began with a lovely drink, the classic painkiller #3, a pina colada but better type drink, it is delicious and fruity but started to wear a little towards the end of the glass, very sweet, we also tried flinn's dilemma, kind of a mojito but tasted mostly like lemonade, it was fine.
8411<>xx<>We began chow with the salmon/potato/corn/spinach enchiladas, which are good as long as you like smokey, kind of chipotleish flavors, these are very strong and filling.
8412<>xx<>Also, the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese with pancetta are on point, both super tasty and good portions for just five bucks.
8413<>xx<>The grilled cheese with tomato soup however is freaking amazing in my mouth.
8414<>xx<>You are seriously missing out if you don't try this cheesy, pancetta packed appetizer.
8415<>xx<>Entree time.
8416<>xx<>We tried the b burger, which got pretty general "it's good" reactions from everyone, but being fair we had recently been to Zinburger and, come on, who can complete with that?
8417<>xx<>The chicken and dumplings were good but there was nothing exceptional about them, I would rather see some kind of a fresh take on a pot pie, there were no complaints, just no raving either.
8418<>xx<>Two people got the green chile pork stew and liked it, but again no shouts of praise and adoration.
8419<>xx<>I asked our waitress to bring me whatever she would order and ended up with the wood fired mussels, a big bowl of big mussels and four fairly large slices of garlic bread.
8420<>xx<>The mussels were good, hard to get out of the shell but meaty and tasty once in your gullet.
8421<>xx<>The broth in the bowl was tasty for bread dipping, but a little too sweet for my tastes, and the bread itself was good with a semi sweet garlic spread on it.
8422<>xx<>Overall a good and hefty meal.
8423<>xx<>We also tried a couple of deserts, the coffee creme brulee was delish but too coffee strong for my buds, the peaches and cream was a hit and the chocolate dipped bacon smores were a little chunk of heaven... big slabs of chocolate covered pig with toasted marshmallows, graham crackers and creamy peanut butter, for only six bucks you HAVE to get this dessert.
8424<>xx<>With strong service, nice ambiance, great starters, great deserts, good drinks and fair prices, Beckett's Table earns a strong four stars from me even with the somewhat lackluster entrees.
8425<>xx<>If the entrees do pick up sometime soon, or I find one that blows me away, this could easily end up a new favorite restaurant of mine.
8426<>xx<>To sum up: Delicious drinks, food was like home cooking with a foodie flare, atmosphere cool, calm, and comfortable with an industrial flare.
8427<>xx<>I would definitely go back and definitely recommend it!
8428<>xx<>The bf surprised me by picking this spot to have dinner the other night and we were both pleased!
8429<>xx<>I didn't have a specific taste for anything on this night, but my guy really wanted chicken and dumplings and had heard good things about them here.
8430<>xx<>We started with an order of zucchini cakes and he had the roasted red pepper tomato soup.
8431<>xx<>I had one of the cakes and must say it was one instance where I didn't mind that I was eating zucchini.
8432<>xx<>I didn't try the soup, but he cleaned the bowl, so it must've been good!
8433<>xx<>For dinner I ended up with a chopped salad as I didn't want anything as heavy as stew or dumplings.
8434<>xx<>It was yummmmy!
8435<>xx<>The champagne vinaigrette was so bright, it was literally like sunshine in my mouth; loved it!
8436<>xx<>It was a great portion and I finished all my veggies...
8437<>xx<>Mom would be so proud.
8438<>xx<>=) They have a number of gluten free and vegetarian items, so it would be a good spot if you're looking for those options.
8439<>xx<>They also have a really nice wine, beer and scotch list with really good prices... Prices were pretty good on everything.
8440<>xx<>We had 2 beers, 1 scotch, soup, app and 2 dinners for $80 with generous tip.
8441<>xx<>I must also add the server was effective and pleasant.
8442<>xx<>I gave it 3 stars because I wasn't outta my mind impressed, but it was good and I would definitely go back.
8443<>xx<>I'm sure the menu will have changed, so maybe I will have to up my stars next visit!
8444<>xx<>Our 2nd time here was last Thursday after my kids traumatic visit to the allergist.... he actually picked Becketts Table for dinner because, well........ he knows Chef Becketts kid......good reason I suppose.
8445<>xx<>So we got there shortly before 5..... there were already people waiting for the doors to open...... We were promptly seated at 5:01, I kid, it was 5:00.
8446<>xx<>OK but really to make a very long story short, I love this place.
8447<>xx<>Service is beyond great..... bacon & cheddar biscuits w/apple butter are delish.....
8448<>xx<>I ordered the petite chicken and it was perfectly moist on the inside crisp on the outside..... the kid had chicken strips & fries.....he loved his meal.
8449<>xx<>The kids father had steamed halibut (special ordered bc he's ridiculous...... and on diet).
8450<>xx<>I liked that they had a kids menu....
8451<>xx<>I liked that our waiter pointed out all of the pig statues to my kid, the pigs even have names.
8452<>xx<>Good job!
8453<>xx<>We will be back.
8454<>xx<>If I could marry a restaurant, it would be Beckett's Table.
8455<>xx<>My husband and I have been there twice, and each time we are blown away by the service and the food.
8456<>xx<>My husband has had the smoked and grilled pork chop with cowboy caviar and he basically licked his plate.
8457<>xx<>The time before, he had pork osso buco.
8458<>xx<>And again....he basically licked his plate.
8459<>xx<>I have had the cheeseburger and the tomato soup/grilled cheese (appetizer, but I had it for a meal).
8460<>xx<>I loved both of them.
8461<>xx<>The desserts are AMAZING.
8462<>xx<>Everyone needs to try chocolate covered bacon - so order the s'more, stat.
8463<>xx<>Beckett's table also has a great ambiance.
8464<>xx<>It isn't too fancy, but just feels perfectly trendy with just the right touch of feeling romantic (if you want it to).
8465<>xx<>Can't wait to go back!
8466<>xx<>I've been here a few times and the food is always tasty, I like the atmosphere, and the service is always above and beyond.
8467<>xx<>The big problem I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out.
8468<>xx<>Every guest inside the restaurant on a Friday night at 7pm was over the age of 40 (besides my wife and I).
8469<>xx<>If you want a trendy place to go this isn't it, but if you're interested in terrific food try Beckett's.
8470<>xx<>Wednesday, October 27, 2010.
8471<>xx<>Opening Night.
8472<>xx<>As we walked in we were greeted by Michelle Beckett (owner/partner) and she had even recognized me from my comment on their facebook page.
8473<>xx<>This meant a lot because it shows that they are taking time and investing in the utilization of social networking.
8474<>xx<>They want to know their customers and build the relationships to become that "neighborhood hangout," or a true Third Place.
8475<>xx<>The decor of the building is absolutely perfect.
8476<>xx<>The dark wood, exposed trusses, brick wall, open kitchen are all inviting and comforting.
8477<>xx<>They did a good job of expressing their business concept in their design; they aren't trying to be pretentious or snooty.
8478<>xx<>They are down to earth and simple with the decor and aesthetics which leads them into being a comfortable neighborhood hangout.
8479<>xx<>I was impressed with the wait staff.
8480<>xx<>They were knowledgeable and had tried everything on the menu.
8481<>xx<>This allowed them to give recommendations and answer questions.
8482<>xx<>Likewise, they weren't your typical high school or college servers.
8483<>xx<>They were seasoned wait staff, and it was apparent.
8484<>xx<>My only comment on the service would be that the timing was a little bit off from ordering 1st course, 2nd course, and the time for our after dinner cocktails.
8485<>xx<>However, these are minimal kinks I would expect on night one, so I see it as a nonissue.
8486<>xx<>Now for the food.
8487<>xx<>The four of us decided to share the Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese ($9).
8488<>xx<>This grilled cheese had four cheeses and pancetta.
8489<>xx<>It was delicious, and the roasted red pepper soup to accompany was great.
8490<>xx<>This plays a lot into Beckett's concept.
8491<>xx<>It's not food that you can't make at home, he's just going to do it a little better, and for a fare price.
8492<>xx<>We ordered a bottle of Page Springs Grenache ($41).
8493<>xx<>It was very nice to see a handful of local wines on the list, this is something that I think all local restaurants should strive to do.
8494<>xx<>It was nice to see chef Justin Beckett be able to escape the kitchen and make rounds in the dining room to greet his guests and thank them for coming, etc.
8495<>xx<>For our main courses we had the Wood Fired Mussels ($18), Fork Tender Short Ribs ($19), Local Pork Osso Buco Confit, and Chicken n Dumplings ($16).
8496<>xx<>The mussels were great.
8497<>xx<>It seems a lot of restaurants are serving mussels in a white wine broth these days (Beckett's Table, Iruna, Liberty Market, etc.).
8498<>xx<>Each of them does it a little bit different, and Beckett's take on this dish is using a fennel broth.
8499<>xx<>Normally I am not a fan of fennel, but it was mild enough, and with the other spices it was a good combination.
8500<>xx<>My only concern (not even a complaint) was the portion of the dish.
8501<>xx<>I had 32 mussels in my bowl.
8502<>xx<>I spoke with Justin after we ate and he mentioned that that was not the correct amount.
8503<>xx<>However, we discussed portioning and he is definitely being generous with the amount of mussels in this dish.
8504<>xx<>I'd say it's a great deal!
8505<>xx<>The short ribs were cooked to perfection, and lived up to the name "fork tender."
8506<>xx<>They were seasoned well with a nice bite of cracked black pepper.
8507<>xx<>A very generous portion as well.
8508<>xx<>The pork osso buco was delicious.
8509<>xx<>It was tender and flavorful.
8510<>xx<>Its side of butternut squash spaetzle was a nice touch.
8511<>xx<>My little brother ordered the chicken n dumplings.
8512<>xx<>These were delicious, and Beckett's take on this nostalgic dish includes saffron in the cream sauce.
8513<>xx<>It created a very smooth flavor that definitely set it apart from all other chicken n dumplings (except our family recipe, of course).
8514<>xx<>We thought about dessert... and well... we had to.
8515<>xx<>Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.
8516<>xx<>Wow.
8517<>xx<>Another great taste combination, taking the smokey, salty flavor of the bacon and dipping it in the sweet chocolate was great.
8518<>xx<>Their marshmallows are house-made, which is just a nice touch.
8519<>xx<>It did come with a dollop of peanut butter whipped cream that complimented the dish.
8520<>xx<>Likewise, we ordered after dinner cocktails.
8521<>xx<>I ordered the Legend City Cocktail.
8522<>xx<>The name is something that will be nostalgic for those that have grown up in the Valley.
8523<>xx<>This drink I feel was a great twist on a classic Old Fashioned.
8524<>xx<>It was Woodford bourbon, Ricard, bitters and a splash of lemonade: served straight up.
8525<>xx<>I thought it was delicious, but I have began to acquire a bias for classic bourbon cocktails.
8526<>xx<>My mom ordered Miss Katie's Pimms Cup.
8527<>xx<>This drink is named after one of the owning partners Katie Stephens, who also came around to our table and introduced herself and chatted with us for a few minutes.
8528<>xx<>My dad, growing up on a farm appreciated and ordered the AZ Farmhand.
8529<>xx<>It contains Hendricks Gin, ginger, lemonade, honey syrup and a splash of soda.
8530<>xx<>Very refreshing drink as well.
8531<>xx<>I will be back Beckett and his staff have done a GREAT job opening this new neighborhood hangout.
8532<>xx<>Romantic, urban and cozy.
8533<>xx<>Three things I love in any restaurant.
8534<>xx<>It's a little pricey but a great place to go for a special occasion.
8535<>xx<>Order the osso bucco, it's divine.
8536<>xx<>Leave room for dessert, and if you are a fan of sangria, such as myself, I'd recommend ordering that too.
8537<>xx<>Our server was incredibly polite (as well as the gentleman who didn't let our water classes even get to half full).
8538<>xx<>I love this place.
8539<>xx<>It's cozy and comfortable.
8540<>xx<>The open kitchen reminds me of home (San Francisco) and so much is made in house.
8541<>xx<>And it makes me feel like I've been invited over for dinner.
8542<>xx<>The first time we tried Beckett's was for their first birthday.
8543<>xx<>I'd been hearing about the restaurant and signed up for the newsletter.
8544<>xx<>My husband couldn't say no when it was 1 dollar entrees for their birthday!
8545<>xx<>We had a fabulous meal!
8546<>xx<>The only complaint I had that night was that my chocolate dessert wasn't quite what I expected and too rich for me.
8547<>xx<>We went again with friends visiting from the UK.
8548<>xx<>We needed a place to go for dinner on a Sunday night and our pickings were limited.
8549<>xx<>A reservation was made for Beckett's (and the Sunday night half price Arizona wines special) and we went.
8550<>xx<>Everyone loved their food.
8551<>xx<>My hubby wasn't feeling too great so he didn't eat much, but he enjoyed what he ordered.
8552<>xx<>Every plate was cleaned as best each person could.
8553<>xx<>I even got to enjoy the chicken the next day for lunch because one of my friends couldn't finish.
8554<>xx<>It was divine reheated!
8555<>xx<>No desserts the second time round, but we did start with the charcuterie board and it was delish!
8556<>xx<>Especially the housemade cranberry preserves.
8557<>xx<>We even bought a jar to take home with us!
8558<>xx<>We're looking forward to going back again.
8559<>xx<>Yum!
8560<>xx<>This place is our new favorite breakfast spot!
8561<>xx<>Everything on the menu is awesome!
8562<>xx<>The prices are a little high for a breakfast joint- but totally worth it!
8563<>xx<>The staff is super friendly and the decor is very cute!
8564<>xx<>Great little find on the way out of town, I will definitely put this on the rotation when I'm in Vegas.
8565<>xx<>I had the eggs benadict and it was amazing best part was the hash Browns, perfectly seasoned with the right amount of crisp.
8566<>xx<>Waitress was great also.
8567<>xx<>Few times I am surprised when it comes to brkfst.
8568<>xx<>Eggs are eggs.
8569<>xx<>This place really rocks.
8570<>xx<>Stopped by on the way home to LA.
8571<>xx<>Best steak & Eggs for the hubby.
8572<>xx<>Kids loved the pot of bread.
8573<>xx<>I recommend the corned beef hash extra crispy.
8574<>xx<>The french press coffee a plus!
8575<>xx<>Take the family.
8576<>xx<>U won't be disappointed.
8577<>xx<>Ask for Lisa.
8578<>xx<>Just the sweetest waitress ever.
8579<>xx<>The pjs are a cute touch.
8580<>xx<>Absolutely love this place.
8581<>xx<>Today was my first time and I don't know how I never knew about it!
8582<>xx<>The atmosphere is very welcoming and the waiters/waitresses are extremely nice as well!
8583<>xx<>Must try the chicken and waffles.... Country fries steak... And the pancakes(flakey and fluffy!!!)
8584<>xx<>!
8585<>xx<>So good!
8586<>xx<>!
8587<>xx<>My husband and I were looking for a breakfast place close to our house one Sunday morning.
8588<>xx<>I suggested Rise and Shine after reading other Yelp reviews.
8589<>xx<>Boy am I glad we did!
8590<>xx<>We have been there a few times and we haven't been disappointed!
8591<>xx<>My favorite so far is the Chicken and Waffles.
8592<>xx<>The fried chicken is AMAZING!!!
8593<>xx<>The batter is super crunchy and the chicken breast is super juicy and tender.
8594<>xx<>I highly recommend coming here for breakfast on the weekends.
8595<>xx<>One of my favorite places for Sunday morning bfast.
8596<>xx<>Love the menu, service and everything.
8597<>xx<>Waiting sucks, restaurant is small, but worth the wait.
8598<>xx<>Unbeknownst to us, we walked in 15 min before closing.
8599<>xx<>I asked when they were shutting down because it was late afternoon and was informed that the doors closed at 3 BUT they were insistent that we please come in and enjoy ourselves.
8600<>xx<>We even heard shouts from the kitchen for us to come in and sit down.
8601<>xx<>Our server told us to take all the time we need and we never once felt like we were keeping anyone from going home.
8602<>xx<>Our experience was super relaxed.
8603<>xx<>The management was incredibly accommodating and pleasant.
8604<>xx<>The food we delicious and very much to our liking.
8605<>xx<>The only reason I didn't not give a 5 out of 5 stars was because I thought the portion for my corned beef hash and eggs was a little light for the price.
8606<>xx<>Other than that we were extremely happy with the food and will be coming back again!
8607<>xx<>Your first thought when walking in?
8608<>xx<>"Look how neat this place is!"
8609<>xx<>Servers in pajamas, upside down flower-print umbrellas hanging from the ceiling (some even spin!
8610<>xx<>), and overall relaxed vibe.
8611<>xx<>The wait for me is usually about 10-20 minutes depending on what time I get there.
8612<>xx<>Like Marie T., this place USED to be my favorite breakfast place.
8613<>xx<>It was also icing on the cake that it is walking distance from my abode.
8614<>xx<>I keep giving them chances to change my mind, but I get disappointed every time.
8615<>xx<>My favorite thing to order is the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet.
8616<>xx<>Thankfully, its taste consistency has remained the same and is always "good."
8617<>xx<>My second favorite would be the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle.
8618<>xx<>I was never a fan of Chicken & Waffles until I ate it at this place.
8619<>xx<>The New York Steak, Spinach, & Benedict-Bagel was the worst thing that I have ever ordered.
8620<>xx<>The presentation was extremely lacking..
8621<>xx<>The words Hot Mess came to mind; which made my food unappetizing.
8622<>xx<>The Pot of Bread for a side is one of the reasons why I keep wanting to come back, but for the last THREE times they have been unable to keep up with the demand and simply say "they're out."
8623<>xx<>Instead, customers have to choose between getting toast or a biscuit.
8624<>xx<>Ugh.
8625<>xx<>If you're a server and you see that my hash browns are either burnt or undercooked then do not bring it out to me.
8626<>xx<>I will say something.
8627<>xx<>Also, we keep getting handed other people's tabs.. get it together guys.
8628<>xx<>I am always pleased with the service and food.
8629<>xx<>I like the Biscuits and Gravy, and the Chicken Fried Steak.
8630<>xx<>I brought my parents while they were in town, and everyone left happy and full.
8631<>xx<>My mom had the pancakes and thought the server outfits were cute.
8632<>xx<>My dad and I had the Chicken Fried Steak.
8633<>xx<>The portions are BIG which could add to the price.
8634<>xx<>Try the chilaquiles!
8635<>xx<>Ordered the Panang Shrimp Bowl... wow!
8636<>xx<>Such beautiful flavors and texture.
8637<>xx<>Mildly spicy.
8638<>xx<>You will need a spoon for this one and I promise... you will Not be disappointed!
8639<>xx<>Still giving them a five star rating despite them keeping the snobby hostesses employed and getting rid of the TLT at this location.
8640<>xx<>Dine there for lunch and dinner  frequently and am never disappointed.
8641<>xx<>Recommend!
8642<>xx<>If healthy eating is your thing, this is one place you can stick to your plan.
8643<>xx<>Vegan and Gluten-Free Options are available and in a variety of items.
8644<>xx<>Enjoy!
8645<>xx<>I was out for a business dinner last night and a client recommended True Food in North Scottsdale.
8646<>xx<>The restaurant itself was trendy and had an awesome atmosphere.
8647<>xx<>It sits in a lifestyle shopping center, but feels like it is by itself.
8648<>xx<>The entire place opens up to the elements and you feel like you are sitting outside even if in the middle of the place.
8649<>xx<>The tables outside wrap around the restaurant like a horseshoe.
8650<>xx<>Cool menu with very fresh ingredients and refreshing beverages.
8651<>xx<>I had the Cool Spring Salad (over ate on this trip and needed something light).
8652<>xx<>The salad had a balsamic vinaigrette dressing with strawberries and blue cheese.
8653<>xx<>It was delicious!
8654<>xx<>The service was great, yet everyone had bronzed tans, which made my Wisconsin style like whiteness even more noticeable in the AZ sunset...  Definitely a great place for a casual dinner or date...
8655<>xx<>Fresh, tasty and consistent.
8656<>xx<>We go there often.
8657<>xx<>I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food.
8658<>xx<>I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options, which is an odd (in a good way) feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out.
8659<>xx<>I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices, but overall I really like this place and will come back.
8660<>xx<>The atmosphere is great and service is attentive.
8661<>xx<>I had:  - Herb hummus: Regular hummus dressed up with greek crudites (olives, cucumber, tomato, feta, etc) served with yummy soft pita bread.
8662<>xx<>This is a great app to share.
8663<>xx<>- Meditterean Salad: Like two meals in one.
8664<>xx<>It was mostly quinoa and my only complaint is that it should come with with more lettuce/arugula or be relabeled as a Quinoa Salad.
8665<>xx<>There were tons of yummy feta and marcona almonds which with the quinoa made a very filling meal.
8666<>xx<>- Strawberry seasonal soda: Yum - fruity and spritzer and so refreshing!
8667<>xx<>Kind of pricey at $4 with no refill, but so perfect for a warm summer day.
8668<>xx<>My first time here.
8669<>xx<>Really enjoying the experience.
8670<>xx<>Not only is the food delicious.
8671<>xx<>It is healthy too
8672<>xx<>Stop changing the menu!
8673<>xx<>This used to be my favorite restaurant.
8674<>xx<>As a vegan, they had multiple options that I was willing to pay more for and wait on weekend nights for.
8675<>xx<>Since I started eating there, I think they have changed the menu 4-5 times.
8676<>xx<>Seasonal food doesn't excite me.
8677<>xx<>Consistency does.
8678<>xx<>I loved the BBQ tofu wrap.
8679<>xx<>It was my favorite meal...gone.
8680<>xx<>Kale cheeseless pizza...gone.
8681<>xx<>Apple crisp with maple ice cream....gone.
8682<>xx<>All that is really left for me is an uninspired teriyaki bowl that I can duplicate elsewhere.
8683<>xx<>The service is great.
8684<>xx<>The staff is friendly.
8685<>xx<>The pricing is a little high, but I was willing to pay it for many vegan choices.
8686<>xx<>I have a couple of gift cards left and I will likely be done after that.
8687<>xx<>5 star food (before the changes).
8688<>xx<>5 star service- GREAT servers!
8689<>xx<>3 star pricing.
8690<>xx<>Zero stars for inconsistency with menu items.
8691<>xx<>I'm between a 2 and 3 on this one, but since I was served a lemon tart that I was told was vegan and found out later it isn't, I'm leaving a 2.
8692<>xx<>If you keep the menu consistent, we likely wouldn't have had this problem.
8693<>xx<>What if I had a dairy allergy?
8694<>xx<>I'm kinda stingy about giving up 5 stars but this place is the real deal.
8695<>xx<>I've been to the Biltmore True Food location and it was OK but I like this new place better.
8696<>xx<>The building has plenty of light and high ceilings.
8697<>xx<>The service is very friendly and efficient.
8698<>xx<>Lots of Scottsdale pretty people dining here to observe as entertainment.
8699<>xx<>I ordered the shrimp dumplings to start.
8700<>xx<>Not only did they taste great but the presentation was beautiful with the dumplings and broccoli.
8701<>xx<>I also ordered the shaved turkey pita.
8702<>xx<>This was enormous and every bite was delicious.
8703<>xx<>I had a nice combination of squash and kale on the side.
8704<>xx<>I like this place a lot and will be back soon.
8705<>xx<>Are you a health nut with boat loads of cash?
8706<>xx<>If so, this place is for you, otherwise, not so much.
8707<>xx<>I can't argue with the notion of healthy, unprocessed, organic food, but this place takes it too far.
8708<>xx<>Consider the beverage choices, ranging in price between $3-5.
8709<>xx<>Offerings include the Red Moon (pink grapefruit, yuzu, agave and soda) and Andy's Elixir (olivella juice, agave nectar and soda water).
8710<>xx<>I Googled olivella juice when I got home and it's made from sea buckthorn berries?
8711<>xx<>In fairness, when I asked the waitress about the bizarre beverage offerings, she told me that Pepsi products were available, but not on the menu.
8712<>xx<>The food menu encompasses a range of odd ingredients such as kale, tempeh, Anasazi beans, and tofu lettuce cups.
8713<>xx<>To be "safe" I ordered the Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl.
8714<>xx<>The entree was 90% vegetables, containing minimal chicken and even less rice.
8715<>xx<>It was so dry; I kept digging for even a pocket of teriyaki sauce.
8716<>xx<>Even so, the dish was artfully presented.
8717<>xx<>The man behind the True Food's brand is Dr. Andy Weil.
8718<>xx<>While I admire him as a physician and originator of integrative medicine, I think he should stay out of the restaurant business.
8719<>xx<>A hip moderate American eatery.
8720<>xx<>We decided to eat here because the kids started to get really hungry from walking the strip all afternoon.
8721<>xx<>I ordered the Strawberry Milkshake and Chicken Fingers & Waffle--and that is what I definitely got.
8722<>xx<>Four chicken fingers and a waffle!
8723<>xx<>haha it was an appetizer but damn i thought i would get at least two waffles!
8724<>xx<>Don't get me wrong the food was delicious but it is a bit pricey!
8725<>xx<>The kids enjoyed their food and at the moment that's what really counted!
8726<>xx<>Holsteins is the best!
8727<>xx<>Read the yelp review and tried 2 famous dishes.
8728<>xx<>Hamburger was okay but it didnt surprised me.... great place in cosmopolitan,  good customer service However, it was too cheesy and salty for me.
8729<>xx<>Came here for lunch with a rather big group, the restaurant was pretty empty at the time.
8730<>xx<>I was very disappointed with the burgers, namely because the bun's were absolutely terrible!
8731<>xx<>I had the Gold Standard with Onion Rings.
8732<>xx<>The burger patty was cooked medium, and all the fix-ins complimented the burger well...but I can't get over the fact that the bun was so terrible.
8733<>xx<>The burger bun was dry, cold, and slightly stale...it was so terrible that I could not enjoy my burger.
8734<>xx<>I almost had to eat the burger patty by itself and toss the bun.
8735<>xx<>Everyone else in my group agreed, the burger bun was stale and dry.
8736<>xx<>If it wasn't for the dry bun, I might be able to give it 4-stars, but I just could not enjoy my burger on a stale dry bun!
8737<>xx<>The burger patty was good quality, but I can't enjoy a burger without a good bun!
8738<>xx<>The onion rings were okay, i've had better, I really wished they were beer battered.
8739<>xx<>For the price of the burgers, I really expected a more satisfying burger; the burgers were not that big to begin with.
8740<>xx<>I think I will stick to Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay.
8741<>xx<>As with everything else in Vegas, high prices don't always equate to high quality.
8742<>xx<>My meal came out to be $25 for a burger, onion rings, and water...for this price I expect a damn good burger, which Holsteins did not deliver.
8743<>xx<>Burger bar has much better burgers, and better prices!
8744<>xx<>I know this is a burger place, but there are so many burger places in Vegas and all the apps looked amazing so we went with the CRISPY PORK BELLY BUN, LOBSTER AND STEAK QUESADILLA and as an afterthought added the SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN FINGERS.
8745<>xx<>I would seriously fly to Vegas just to have those chicken fingers again!!
8746<>xx<>AMAZINGGG Best thing I have eaten in Vegas and this was my 5th time there.
8747<>xx<>The quesadilla was ok and the pork belly buns were great after I removed the cucumber and pea shoots.
8748<>xx<>For dessert we had the CANDY STORE... You can ask them to sub items if there is something you don't want but really it looked better than it tasted.
8749<>xx<>I would rather go someplace else and spend $15 on dessert.
8750<>xx<>The Potato Chip Rocher had dark chocolate which I did not enjoy, the almond joy drum stick tasted like the ice cream was freezer burnt... really nothing special.
8751<>xx<>Also, I noted on the reservation it was my husband's 30th birthday and they didn't even acknowledge it.
8752<>xx<>This place has been reviewed a bit on Yelp, and the 4-star is about par for the course.
8753<>xx<>The atmosphere is very lively, but that might have been just because there was a Thursday night football game going on at the time of our meal.
8754<>xx<>Either way, it definitely seems like the place gets a lot of action.
8755<>xx<>Gotta love the decor of the place: cartoon cows   We had the Thai Beef Salad, the Gold Standard, and the Oreo shake.
8756<>xx<>Watch out for the Thai Beef Salad!
8757<>xx<>It's good but it has a sweet/super spicy sauce mixed into it... it tasted a lot like Korean gochujang.
8758<>xx<>The Gold Standard lived exactly to its expectations, but what else would expect from a $20 burger?
8759<>xx<>And the Oreo shake was the perfect mix of thick consistency: not too watery but not thick enough that you feel like you need to suck your brains out through the straw.
8760<>xx<>The place IS expensive (my only semi gripe about the place... it's hard to justify buying a $20 beef sandwich) but you're in Vegas so just deal with it!
8761<>xx<>The place is far from a 'deal' meal, but I would still highly recommend it.
8762<>xx<>Adult milk shakes are great.
8763<>xx<>I really thought it was going to be explosive.
8764<>xx<>but it was ok.
8765<>xx<>I was expecting a huge gourmet burger.
8766<>xx<>instead i got a over priced burger with ok fries.
8767<>xx<>The fried pickles are a disappointment.
8768<>xx<>I also had the soft shell crab bruschetta.
8769<>xx<>It was good but could of been way bettter.
8770<>xx<>over all it was ok. but the stars are for the lack of burger enthusiasm.
8771<>xx<>Where do I possibly start....
8772<>xx<>It's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.
8773<>xx<>Quite possibly some of the best shakes I ever had.
8774<>xx<>So why just one star?
8775<>xx<>Well...
8776<>xx<>When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...
8777<>xx<>I would have even settled for mediocre...
8778<>xx<>Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...
8779<>xx<>I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.
8780<>xx<>So how bad was it?
8781<>xx<>Well...
8782<>xx<>Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?
8783<>xx<>Well... this was worse.
8784<>xx<>This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...
8785<>xx<>So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?
8786<>xx<>No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.
8787<>xx<>At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.
8788<>xx<>I really wanted to like this burger.
8789<>xx<>Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.
8790<>xx<>The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...
8791<>xx<>But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.
8792<>xx<>The waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.
8793<>xx<>Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that.
8794<>xx<>If I ever go back to Cosmo, I might have a shake there, but never another burger.
8795<>xx<>What a waste.
8796<>xx<>After driving 6  1/2 hours vs the usual less than 4 to vegas, we were too tired to drive to Bachi, so we decided to try Holsteins.
8797<>xx<>Besides H, another couple joined us for dinner.
8798<>xx<>1.
8799<>xx<>H had the Billionaire Burger (Kobe with foie gras), disappointment.
8800<>xx<>Foie gras was wayyy overcooked and hard, we couldn't taste any of the port onion marmalade nor the truffle mayo that's supposed to be part of it.
8801<>xx<>I will pay $15, not $32 for it.
8802<>xx<>2.
8803<>xx<>I had the Big Fat Greek (lamb burger).
8804<>xx<>It was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty.
8805<>xx<>The olive relish was almost as thick as the burger, wtheck!
8806<>xx<>3.
8807<>xx<>Male friend ordered the Rising Sun(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal.
8808<>xx<>Soo yummy, but I think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it.
8809<>xx<>:\ 4.
8810<>xx<>My 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice.
8811<>xx<>Maine lobster roll for $16.50.
8812<>xx<>The two rolls were COLD, and they were not rolls, at least not where I came from haha.Those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks.
8813<>xx<>Two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'.
8814<>xx<>Wtheck!
8815<>xx<>Our server Adam never cracked a smile.
8816<>xx<>I can't say the service was bad, but just very basic.
8817<>xx<>I also didn't like the fact that he took our dessert menus away for the table next to us without asking first.
8818<>xx<>i wasn't done yet!
8819<>xx<>So we didn't order any.
8820<>xx<>I would like to leave a 10% tip but given that we were with another couple (haha), I reluctantly added 15% :P  Won't be back because it's not yummy.
8821<>xx<>I came here on a Saturday morning.
8822<>xx<>The service was excellent.
8823<>xx<>I sat at the bar by myself, and the brunette-long-hair bartender seemed to know how tough it is for a girl to sit by herself.
8824<>xx<>So she was extremely sweet and helpful to me.
8825<>xx<>She was chilled, but you know that she is very serious about customer service.
8826<>xx<>Yes, in addition, anybody who calls me sweetie is automatically considered to give good service in my book!
8827<>xx<>However, the food and the drinks were not on par with the good service.
8828<>xx<>I ordered two cocktails: upside down pineapple birthday cake and tropical splash.
8829<>xx<>The drinks were beautiful but weak.
8830<>xx<>I know that it was in the morning and kind of early to get buzzed, but I am in Vegas so what?
8831<>xx<>For food, I ordered the billionaire burger.
8832<>xx<>I really LOVE...the name of this burger.
8833<>xx<>Yes, paying $28.00 to supposedly eat like a billionaire.
8834<>xx<>Why not?
8835<>xx<>Another reason is that it kind of feeds my delusion of wealth.
8836<>xx<>I love every single ingredient listed for the burger: Kobe beef, foie gras, truffle mayo, caramelized onion, but I do not love the burger together.
8837<>xx<>It felt as it needs some kind of sauce to bring it together, just a suggestion.
8838<>xx<>Overall, I would come back here for the atmosphere and the service.
8839<>xx<>But the drinks and the burger were absolutely not the best.
8840<>xx<>Some friends and I arrive and are greeted promptly by the hostess.
8841<>xx<>We choose to sit at the bar for the conversation with the bartenders and football being shown on television.
8842<>xx<>Comme Ça offers a wide range of pre-prohibition cocktails, extensive wine list and limited craft beer on draft.
8843<>xx<>I order a Dogfish Head 90min IPA.
8844<>xx<>Draft beers are served in chilled glasses, which is not always a good option, and a non chilled glass was unavailable.
8845<>xx<>We started with appetizers, Tarte Flambée, Duck Confit, and Escargots.
8846<>xx<>All excellent choices with the Escargots being some of the best I've ever had, and I love the new plating.
8847<>xx<>I order a Comme Ça Burger.
8848<>xx<>Deliciously prepared.
8849<>xx<>The hardest part is trying not devour it to quickly.
8850<>xx<>There was a mistake and an order of Charred Calamari was offered to us.
8851<>xx<>This was the highlight of the night.
8852<>xx<>Served in Squid ink, it's fantastic.
8853<>xx<>I will be ordering this again and you must try.
8854<>xx<>Mixologist Lyn and bartender Melissa offer great conversation and knowledge.
8855<>xx<>Friendly and personable also.
8856<>xx<>Overall I have been to Comme Ça many times and it never disappoints.
8857<>xx<>Service, food, ambiance all top notch.
8858<>xx<>I encourage you to visit.
8859<>xx<>I'll be at the bar with the Escargots and Charred Calamari.
8860<>xx<>Me and my girlfriend decided (spontaneously) to try this restaurant since we both never been to this restaurant.
8861<>xx<>All I can say, we/I enjoyed our meal.
8862<>xx<>We had the escargot, frog legs (which I had for the first time & it was tasty), lamb (that melts in your mouth), crispy pork belly (which I think is very unhealthy but crazy delicious) & definitely had a glass of Pinot Grigio & Riesling to go along with our dinner.
8863<>xx<>But the service was "okay" - I'm sorry.
8864<>xx<>Will I go back again in the future?
8865<>xx<>possible!
8866<>xx<>Will I recommend this place?
8867<>xx<>based on the food, yes!
8868<>xx<>Review based on the bar and drinks only.
8869<>xx<>On a week night I went down to the Cosmo with a friend for a concert and to redeem free drinks at Comme Ca.
8870<>xx<>They run contests on their Twitter to win two free drinks off of their 18a cocktail menus.
8871<>xx<>Very cool of them.
8872<>xx<>Comme Ca is tucked into the corner of the restaurant level of The Cosmo.
8873<>xx<>I really liked the bar area with the plethora of seating.
8874<>xx<>The ambiance is very conducive to just coming here and having a few drinks with friends.
8875<>xx<>Also, I believe it would be a very nice atmosphere for a date.
8876<>xx<>I had the Rumble.
8877<>xx<>A drink they make with season fruit (mine had raspberries), The fruit is "muddled" aka smashed down in the bottom of the glass, and alcohol is added and topped with crushed ice.
8878<>xx<>The presentation was nothing short of spectacular.
8879<>xx<>All cocktails are $12.
8880<>xx<>Now I need to go back and try the food and perhaps sit on their outside patio they have!
8881<>xx<>After a day of hanging out at the Marquee Dayclub w/ no food and all drinks - this was the place we decided to go to for dinner.
8882<>xx<>It wasn't too crowded when we went, but I kind of liked that it gave a more private setting.
8883<>xx<>The hostess & waiters were highly attentive & professional.
8884<>xx<>The salmon was perfect.
8885<>xx<>... the perfect portion for my tummy too.
8886<>xx<>My b/f got the burger which came w/ fries that were golden & light & crisp.
8887<>xx<>I couldn't help but to have more than just one fry.
8888<>xx<>If the weather is nice, ask to sit outside  :]  Wouldn't mind coming back here to try the bone marrow since I JUST saw it on their online menu.
8889<>xx<>This restaurant really fits in at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
8890<>xx<>The atmosphere is very sleek and trendy, but I just fear that like also like the hotel, the restaurant does not live up to the hype.
8891<>xx<>We ate on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful view of the strip.
8892<>xx<>We started with a cheese course and enjoyed that very much.
8893<>xx<>Our entrees were Beef Bourguignon, the Crispy Skate, and the Beef Stroganoff.
8894<>xx<>The food was ok.  All of the dishes sounded great, but they just didn't wow us.
8895<>xx<>The service was pretty inattentive.
8896<>xx<>They forgot one of our drinks and our order of pommes frites.
8897<>xx<>We also had to flag a few people down throughout the meal to get refills on water and bread.
8898<>xx<>For the price, I definitely would try somewhere else in Vegas.
8899<>xx<>Save your money for Spago.
8900<>xx<>Bone Marrow & Oxtail Jam a.k.a.
8901<>xx<>Bone Marrow & some very good/reduced beef stew.
8902<>xx<>It was quite delicious, and rich in flavor.
8903<>xx<>I had issues with how it was served with these odd, finger sized, crackers.
8904<>xx<>It was really difficult to spread the marrow on them, as well as getting the "jam" to stay in place since it's really decent sized pieces of beef.
8905<>xx<>Also, the seating was odd for three people, so I didn't notice the sea salt on one end of the slate the food was served on.
8906<>xx<>The marrow really needed that salt.
8907<>xx<>***  Beef Tartare!
8908<>xx<>Truly delicious.
8909<>xx<>Perfectly seasoned, and a large serving.
8910<>xx<>Probably more beef than my buddies burger.
8911<>xx<>I shared this with my two friends, and we all enjoyed it.
8912<>xx<>It was the favorite at the table.
8913<>xx<>*****  I highly suggest you visit early in the night during the happy hour.
8914<>xx<>Great food at a decent price.
8915<>xx<>Dinner Service was really enjoyable.
8916<>xx<>The atmosphere was nice, not too loud but not silent either, it had a nice ambiance and our server was very prompt.
8917<>xx<>To start the Bone Marrow with Oxtail Jam was extremely decadent, I extremely enjoyed it although you must be prepared for a higher calorie count on that particular item.
8918<>xx<>Secondly the Steak Tartare was wonderfully well done although the side pickled items resembled a miniature version of the pickled items at any Taqueria, which is not necessarily a bad thing per say.
8919<>xx<>For my Entree I had the Beef Cheek which was well prepared being tender and moist.
8920<>xx<>The croquette that accompanied it had a nice light flavor to it.
8921<>xx<>She had a filet Mignon which again was well prepared, medium rare perfectly cooked.
8922<>xx<>The view of the strip is gorgeous, and the space was ample.
8923<>xx<>Definitely a place worth looking into if you are a fan of the french genre.
8924<>xx<>This restaurant became my to go spot  when I am craving oysters while staying at the Cosmo.
8925<>xx<>With oysters, my favorite beer and bison burger this place had everything I wanted after a long day by the pool.
8926<>xx<>Service was good and the patio was packed.
8927<>xx<>One thing I noticed is that service is better when Comme Ca is packed.
8928<>xx<>You can feel that the servers are hustling and food comes out perfect.
8929<>xx<>I assume that the executive chef is there for dinner service only.
8930<>xx<>When you walk in for lunch and the restaurant is empty its a hit or miss.
8931<>xx<>Took almost an hour to get a med rare burger and a french onion soup.
8932<>xx<>When the day before everything came out  in about 20 min.
8933<>xx<>The view from the restaurant is fantastic.
8934<>xx<>Whether seating inside or outside ask to sit at a table with a view and you will not regret your visit here.
8935<>xx<>Will def check it out again when staying at the Cosmo.
8936<>xx<>Delicious, romantic and upscale Vegas restaurant.
8937<>xx<>We took advantage of an internet deal and went on a warm Tues night.
8938<>xx<>We made reservations and were greeted immediately and escorted right to our table.
8939<>xx<>Our waitress, Martika, was awesome.
8940<>xx<>Sooo friendly, professional and sweet.
8941<>xx<>Whenever you go to such an upscale place with a deal coupon you sometimes feel like they'll treat you differently, but not here.
8942<>xx<>They were ready and willing, even had a cool specially made TravelZoo 4-course menu!
8943<>xx<>We sat outside on the dazzling patio (why anyone would sit inside at Comme Ca, I'll never know) and had a great time.
8944<>xx<>Food was delish.
8945<>xx<>The Scottish Salmon still makes my mouth water just remembering it!
8946<>xx<>5 stars!
8947<>xx<>Since we booked our trip to Vegas not realizing it was Easter weekend we decided to make reservations to go to brunch at Comme Ca.
8948<>xx<>Kinda wish we hadn't.
8949<>xx<>Our group of 4 all decided to get the brunch special and it was nothing special at all.
8950<>xx<>The meats, cheeses and sautéed veggies were good, but I felt pretty let down by everything else.
8951<>xx<>Also, there really wasn't much variety.
8952<>xx<>I had to make myself feel better for spending money on yet another blah Vegas meal by downing a Bloody Mary...  And then 4 mimosas...  Maybe their regular menu is better?
8953<>xx<>I'll probably never know...  Oh, and let me once again mention my new pet peeve - DO NOT wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while I am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.
8954<>xx<>Again, clearing plates and other dishes is fine.
8955<>xx<>What the hell is with these overpriced places being totally RUDE?
8956<>xx<>!
8957<>xx<>I don't think you can ever leave Steak n Shake feeling hungry or as if you were ripped off.
8958<>xx<>The portions are extremely generous, especially when you consider the prices.
8959<>xx<>What was a real treat is how good all of the options are.
8960<>xx<>Just because it's affordable, doesn't mean it's good.
8961<>xx<>You won't be let down.
8962<>xx<>I've been here about 4 times (we make it a point to stop in while in Vegas).
8963<>xx<>I've always had something different, and havent been let down.
8964<>xx<>Waited long for service, but its okay I understand since it was busy, but no apology?!
8965<>xx<>That, im very disappointed.
8966<>xx<>Especially the fact that the guy was behind, where I could clearly see him, by the kitchen talking to BOTH the manager and the hostess.
8967<>xx<>During our meal?
8968<>xx<>NOT A SINGLE SMILE!
8969<>xx<>wouldnt come back here.
8970<>xx<>Word of advice: go to johnny rockets.
8971<>xx<>Same food,  much better service & nicer staff.
8972<>xx<>came here for the chili spagetti got it 5 way was really good !
8973<>xx<>other food looked good waiter was supernice can wait to go back!
8974<>xx<>08/09/11: Another star lost from my review.
8975<>xx<>We walked up to a promising sight, the line to be seated was 100% EMPTY.
8976<>xx<>This is the first time I had ever seen it like that.
8977<>xx<>Within moments, we were seated and our party of 4 began chatting and catching up.
8978<>xx<>FIFTEEN MINUTES passed before our server, Rodrigo, decided to stop by our table.
8979<>xx<>We had enough time to decide what we wanted in that time, so drink and food orders were given at the same time.
8980<>xx<>Rodrigo read them back properly, it was promising that my order would not be messed up again (The last two times when I asked for EXTRA sauce on the side, my sandwich would have no sauce on it).
8981<>xx<>We were rather surprised when our food came out within a couple minutes.
8982<>xx<>Well, most of it did.
8983<>xx<>Somehow, between reading back our order correctly and inputting it into their order computer, our server managed to forget to put in some of my food.
8984<>xx<>The foodrunner ran back and made sure the last bit was cooked and arrived very quickly too.
8985<>xx<>All of the special order requests and extra sides (with sauce on the sandwich) were correct.
8986<>xx<>Almost.
8987<>xx<>For some reason, they decided to put the wrong cheese on my sandwich, but the guests sitting across from me, who ordered the same sandwich, all had the proper cheese.
8988<>xx<>Little things add up when you are annoyed!
8989<>xx<>Even better than the special orders being right, this visit, the cooks managed to actually grill the bread!
8990<>xx<>I won't dock the restaurant for this next bit, but the older, grandmother looking lady (she had what looked to be 3 generations in her party) kept staring at our table (which was in the corner) with a scowl on her face.
8991<>xx<>It was kind of creeping me out.
8992<>xx<>07/07/11: The food is almost always perfect.
8993<>xx<>The service is hit or miss.
8994<>xx<>Although, the worse the service, the more true to form this location is to all of the other steak n shakes I have had the pleasure of eating at during many trips back east.
8995<>xx<>review is WAY OVER DUE!...
8996<>xx<>RETRO THEME!
8997<>xx<>loved it.
8998<>xx<>how about lets end our vegas trip with burgers and milkshakes?
8999<>xx<>before hitting the road back to LA, the roomies and I wanted to get lunch and we came across steak n shake.
9000<>xx<>when we arrived the place was packed so we waited in line outside.
9001<>xx<>we waited for awhile before getting seated, so you can only imagine how hungry we had gotten by then.
9002<>xx<>i order the spicy chipotle burger which was yummy.
9003<>xx<>not to dry and full of flavors.
9004<>xx<>pricing of a fast food joint but ambiance of the 50s :)
9005<>xx<>Pretty much have loved this place since the first time I visited.
9006<>xx<>The food is great and the prices are decent!
9007<>xx<>The service we received on the trip we made today was excellent!
9008<>xx<>Our server was on the ball and very attentive, he even made sure to bring us refills on drinks without us asking :) Our food came out quickly with no hiccups and  everything was hot and delicious!
9009<>xx<>I also love the fact that they have more than just the kiddie menu and crayons for the kids to stay occupied while waiting for our food, my girls were happy and content the entire time!
9010<>xx<>This place is clean and the service rocks, food is awesome and it's definitely worth the trip!
9011<>xx<>We'll be visiting Steak n Shake time and time again!
9012<>xx<>This place can get busy so beware of a possible wait especially on weekends and peak dining hours.
9013<>xx<>This place sucked beginning to end.
9014<>xx<>Long wait at the door, ok.
9015<>xx<>Solid 10 minutes before our order is taken, and, wait for it... 45 minutes for some burgers and fries.
9016<>xx<>Double cheeseburger and chipotle burger were both totally overbooked and dried out.
9017<>xx<>A tiny drop of chipotle sauce lurking under the lettuce was barely noticeable on the dry bun.
9018<>xx<>This might have easily been the crappiest  burger I have ever eaten.
9019<>xx<>Avoid the place like the plague !
9020<>xx<>I really like, not love, this place.
9021<>xx<>I've gone twice, long wait both times, but not horribly long.
9022<>xx<>First time just me and the husband.
9023<>xx<>I got chilli cheese fries, won't make that mistake again.
9024<>xx<>They were pretty crappy.
9025<>xx<>But the mushroom burger was tasty.
9026<>xx<>We had went after a movie, where we had some popcorn and that junk so there wasn't room for a shake.
9027<>xx<>This last time we took the kids and they really enjoyed it also.
9028<>xx<>They got little paper cars to put together with stickers that were cute.
9029<>xx<>On to the food: I got the mushroom burger again cause it was just so good the first time, as did my husband.
9030<>xx<>It did not disappoint.
9031<>xx<>Don't get me wrong their not gourmet burgers by far, but their good.
9032<>xx<>Servings aren't huge, but the prices aren't either.
9033<>xx<>Nice selection of shakes we got the cookies and cream and butterfinger.
9034<>xx<>I'd take the fam back for sure.
9035<>xx<>It wasnt that much more then say Mc Donalds but a far better experience
9036<>xx<>This, hands-down, was the best, most amazing burger/shake joint I have ever been to.
9037<>xx<>It's cheaper than fast food for a burger/shake.
9038<>xx<>It's amazing.
9039<>xx<>It's amazing.
9040<>xx<>IT'S EFFING AMAZING.
9041<>xx<>go go go!
9042<>xx<>The Burgers taste like in and out burgers and tehy are just as good.
9043<>xx<>Great service and great attutude from everyone.
9044<>xx<>Cheap to eat here with a good portion of what ever you order.
9045<>xx<>Ahh, Wicked Spoon, the overly hyped buffet in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.
9046<>xx<>Everything "looks" like it'll be wonderful, but trust a fellow Yelp Elite.. LOOKS CAN BE, AND IN THIS CASE, ARE, DECEIVING.
9047<>xx<>*disclaimer: My bf and I are not food snobs, we just know the difference between food with great ingredients versus food without.
9048<>xx<>I came to Vegas expecting to gain at least 1-2 pounds, yet I returned home disappointed.
9049<>xx<>How could a buffet fail at making me gain weight?!
9050<>xx<>I'll tell you why.
9051<>xx<>The boyfriend (a chef in the bay area) and I decided to go to this establishment, despite his coworker's warning that most of the Las Vegas buffets are horrible.
9052<>xx<>Of course, my stubborn self persisted, and to my disappointment, I ended up completely unhappy with the food.
9053<>xx<>It was $40 a person for dinner on a Sunday evening.
9054<>xx<>For that price, I was hoping to taste mediocre to decent food.
9055<>xx<>The Asian station was a complete fail.
9056<>xx<>The ramen was the only thing I was able to finish.
9057<>xx<>The Thai fried rice was plain, the sushi was horrible (no surprise there - buffet sushi), and the meat/vegetable dishes were just bad.
9058<>xx<>This was the first station I tried, and already I had a bad feeling it was not going to be any better.
9059<>xx<>The fried chicken was horrible because the crispy outer part was overly salty, while the chicken meat itself was super bland.
9060<>xx<>The mushroom risotto was totally not balanced, and tasted completely like mushroom, nothing else to balance the flavor.
9061<>xx<>The duck confit ravioli was dry and lacked enough cheese to balance the duck inside.
9062<>xx<>It was very dry and bland in my mouth.
9063<>xx<>My boyfriend said the korean ribs were burnt and had no flavor, and he picked the freshest ones!
9064<>xx<>The crab legs were good, but they were not seasoned and you had to flavor them yourselves.. so that is kind of a given.
9065<>xx<>The only good things I enjoyed were the breads and desserts.
9066<>xx<>I thought the caramelized onion pizza was yummy, as were the random breads from the bread station.
9067<>xx<>The gelato was decent.
9068<>xx<>The mango flavored macaroon was pretty bad.
9069<>xx<>The service at this place was pretty good, we were often checked up on.
9070<>xx<>The service is what saves this review from being a one star... something I rarely give.
9071<>xx<>If you want to go ahead and still visit The Wicked Spoon after reading this review, you must either   a.)
9072<>xx<>enjoy finding the silver lining  b.)
9073<>xx<>have messed up taste buds, that or none at all (:P)   You have been warned!
9074<>xx<>Le boyfriend and I have decided to no longer try out or visit any Las Vegas buffets in the future.
9075<>xx<>Yep.
9076<>xx<>It was that serious.
9077<>xx<>::sad face::
9078<>xx<>As far as Vegas buffets go, Wicked Spoon is hard to beat.
9079<>xx<>I've been for both brunch and dinner on multiple occasions, and there is always an impressive selection of many different types of food for both.
9080<>xx<>I prefer the brunch for a few reasons:   1) The option for BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS for $15 or so.
9081<>xx<>Go with the right crowd and you can start your Vegas partying off right -- the last time we went, the waiters just brought out bottles on ice for us.
9082<>xx<>Nice touch.
9083<>xx<>2) Brunch is less crowded.
9084<>xx<>We waited upwards of 45 minutes to be seated for dinner, while we walked right in at brunch on a Saturday morning.
9085<>xx<>3) I'd much rather gorge myself on breakfast goodies like pumpkin pancakes, french toast, and biscuits n' gravy, but that's just a personal preference.
9086<>xx<>The only reason it doesn't get that 5th star is because it's really pricey.
9087<>xx<>$100 for two people at brunch isn't chump change, especially when you can eat just as much at Hash House for less than half that cost.
9088<>xx<>we were hungry 5 girls.
9089<>xx<>.
9090<>xx<>.
9091<>xx<>I LOVE this place!
9092<>xx<>I've been here twice and received amazing service!
9093<>xx<>Our water glasses were NEVER empty.
9094<>xx<>The service was fast and friendly.
9095<>xx<>I recently came here during EDC 2012 wknd.
9096<>xx<>.
9097<>xx<>.one of THE most craziest and busiest wknds!!!
9098<>xx<>Everything I tried was delish!!!
9099<>xx<>i really liked the salamon and asian green salad!
9100<>xx<>The chocolate strawberries were 2 die 4. .
9101<>xx<>.they were massive and juicy.
9102<>xx<>.
9103<>xx<>.jst how we like it!
9104<>xx<>HAHA.
9105<>xx<>.
9106<>xx<>.get ur mind out of the gutter!
9107<>xx<>This is one of my favorite buffets, even tho its hidden in the back of the cosmo.
9108<>xx<>.
9109<>xx<>.well worth it!
9110<>xx<>I was very sad to learn that there was no mac and cheese bar at lunch... however, this place gets 4 stars for:  1.
9111<>xx<>Damn good Korean BBQ!!!!
9112<>xx<>2.
9113<>xx<>Really really good desserts 3.
9114<>xx<>Beautiful presentation 4.
9115<>xx<>Unique dishes for a Vegas Buffet  But I think I'd prefer coming for dinner next time.
9116<>xx<>The dishes seem more impressive in  way that would be worth the 5 or whatever more dollars you pay.
9117<>xx<>my favorite buffet in las vegas.
9118<>xx<>after so many trips to vegas and being able to sample all of the buffets (either over time and/or via the Buffet of Buffets 24hr pass), there are a few reasons why Wicked Spoon is my favorite.
9119<>xx<>the price is right up there with the costs of eating at the other premiere buffets on the Strip (the Rio, the Bacchanal, the Bellagio) but considering the many different varieties of entrees and desserts, it's the best bang for your buck.
9120<>xx<>the kicker is that for $10 extra during brunch, you can add bottomless mimosas, bloody mary's, and champagne which more than pays for itself after you've had a couple to go along with your meal.
9121<>xx<>it's a good way to sit back and welcome the afternoon with friends!
9122<>xx<>aside from your standard buffet must have's like the prime rib, roast beef, crab legs, and short ribs.
9123<>xx<>but they also have dishes that are a nice twist and a treat considering i don't get to eat that way often like the goat cheese mac & cheese, oysters, crab cakes, and bone marrow.
9124<>xx<>the desserts are delicious: gelato, thai tea ice cream, pastries, cake pops, and pecan tarts highlight the dessert section if you want a step up from the usual apple pie, cookies, or jello.
9125<>xx<>by comparison, the new Bacchanal at the Caesar's Palace is great, but not "worth paying almost $20 more than what you'd pay at WS" great.
9126<>xx<>they also take part in the Buffet of Buffets pass, but to dine there, you have to pay an additional $15 (after you've already paid $50 for the pass itself).
9127<>xx<>and when i ate there a few months ago, i didn't see any dishes that weren't served at WS that would justify the difference in price.
9128<>xx<>enjoy!
9129<>xx<>-civilities.
9130<>xx<>My mom and I visited the Wicked Spoon buffet on our latest trip to Vegas.
9131<>xx<>The bus ride was really convenient since it stopped right in front of one of the entrances to the Cosmopolitan hotel.
9132<>xx<>The buffet is a far walk from the entrance, so that helped build up our appetites for the brunch we were heading to.
9133<>xx<>Brunch was $22 and included a mimosa, bloody mary, or champagne.
9134<>xx<>There was also a large bottled water on each table so you could serve yourself.
9135<>xx<>I liked how the dishes were portioned off.
9136<>xx<>I loved the angry mac and cheese (I had two servings of that).
9137<>xx<>The Asian slaw was also tasty.
9138<>xx<>The dressing was stellar and it had a little spice to it as well.
9139<>xx<>I was a little disappointed with the two pieces of shrimp cocktail though.
9140<>xx<>I had to take a few cups at a time to fulfill my cravings.
9141<>xx<>I didn't try any of the pizza or the other "Asian" choices.
9142<>xx<>I was full by the time I got my dessert, which included the popular chocolate-covered strawberries, a macaroon, and some mango gelato.
9143<>xx<>When I come back to Vegas again, I will definitely come back for a return visit to the Wicked Spoon.
9144<>xx<>While this buffet is a tad pricey, I felt as though it was worth the price.
9145<>xx<>The food quality was good, there was quite a bit of variety and the atmosphere, like the rest of the hotel, was trendy but not overpowering.
9146<>xx<>One of my favorite parts about this buffet was how many items were served in individual portions.
9147<>xx<>Yes, there were also some "standard" buffet style items but there were also small pots of portioned out items.
9148<>xx<>The mac & cheese station will be a hit with adults and children alike, allowing you to choose a type of cheese and a variety of items before they prepare the mac and cheese before you eyes.
9149<>xx<>The dessert selections were varied and delicious!
9150<>xx<>I was pleased with absolutely everything I tried from the sushi to the pasta to the chocolate dipped marshmallow.
9151<>xx<>This is a great environment once you get in.
9152<>xx<>The line to pay and get seated can be quite long, especially if you come during brunch buffet hours.
9153<>xx<>It's around $28 per person.
9154<>xx<>The buffet itself is pretty good.
9155<>xx<>They have some great items and a few misses.
9156<>xx<>Overall you will have very good food prepared carefully, which is a challenge at a buffet.
9157<>xx<>Service for clearing plates from the table is very good.
9158<>xx<>They have good ranging from sushi to pork belly to omelets to kale salad.
9159<>xx<>I would say there are about 100 items in the buffet.
9160<>xx<>My favorites: 1.
9161<>xx<>Creamed corn 2.
9162<>xx<>Pumpkin pancake 3.
9163<>xx<>All the desserts  4.
9164<>xx<>Spaghetti with mushrooms 5.
9165<>xx<>Porkbelly
9166<>xx<>Terrible service!
9167<>xx<>After paying I was seated rather quickly but it went down hill after that.
9168<>xx<>The waitress didn't acknowledged that we even needed service until I complained about it 25 minutes later.
9169<>xx<>She was avoiding our table and the one next to us.
9170<>xx<>After we complained she finally came over to act friendly because her boss heard about it.
9171<>xx<>While the entire length of the non - service she never asked us what we would like to drink or even greeted us.
9172<>xx<>The only common denominator was that we and the table next to us were not white.
9173<>xx<>She seemed to be serving all the white people in her area non stop the whole time.
9174<>xx<>I felt embarrassed and frustrated that I had to complain to a manager and nothing changed even then.
9175<>xx<>Food was okay and lacking in variety but decent.
9176<>xx<>Price was not worth the aggravation.
9177<>xx<>We left after eating without being asked if we wanted a drink the entire service.
9178<>xx<>I will never go to this buffet ever again.
9179<>xx<>I also will not recommend this to the many friends that visit Las Vegas.
9180<>xx<>We weren't the only ones that experienced this racist waitress.
9181<>xx<>Avoid this like the plague.
9182<>xx<>White people only.
9183<>xx<>Sorry but that's how everyone in her area that wasn't white felt like.
9184<>xx<>Three other groups also as we were leaving had no service.
9185<>xx<>Shitty Valentines day!
9186<>xx<>Not sure why this place has 4 Stars.
9187<>xx<>The food here really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
9188<>xx<>LITeRaL!!
9189<>xx<>I went here last night 4/18/2014, my husband and I had read the reviews and though he was skeptical, I convinced him to go.
9190<>xx<>When we walked in the atmosphere was really nice, trendy, clean, roomy.
9191<>xx<>But once we got to the food stations, things turned for the worse.
9192<>xx<>Luckily, my husband got a refund while I on the other hand wasted $41, to eat tasteless food.
9193<>xx<>I don't plan on coming back.
9194<>xx<>Here's why::  Con's 1) The food was either over or under cooked.
9195<>xx<>I grabbed a box of the pre made Chinese noodles and they were over cooked, ingredients did not taste fresh,like maybe they were cooked and sat out for a few hours.
9196<>xx<>Also, I grabbed a drumstick of the Tandori chicken and it was way undercooked.
9197<>xx<>2) Limited options for none meat-eaters.
9198<>xx<>Because I don't eat beef for pork I only had a couple of options for chicken and fish.
9199<>xx<>The teriyaki chicken was undercooked.
9200<>xx<>Also,  the friend chicken, taste like they had been using recycled oil, YUCK!
9201<>xx<>I pretty much ate small slices of pizza and their caeser salad (that's not worth $41 bucks).
9202<>xx<>3) More with the taste, even the cookies were not fresh, they tasted like pre-packaged cookies.
9203<>xx<>4) The variety was limited overall.
9204<>xx<>Pro's 1) atmosphere 2) MacN Cheese station (this was cool.)
9205<>xx<>Love Jaleo!
9206<>xx<>The first time I went was with some girlfriends and the second time was with a larger group for a friend's birthday.
9207<>xx<>Both visits were fantastic.
9208<>xx<>I liken Jaleo as the Comopolitan's version of Firefly.
9209<>xx<>The tapas are delicious.
9210<>xx<>Some of my favorite eats:  -bacon figs -manchengo bread -oysters -croquettas -paella (they generally only have two available on a given night and there is a man dedicated to just cooking paella, it's cool to watch) -sangria  Have dinner here and then head over to chandelier bar for a cocktail :)
9211<>xx<>I've had tapas in San Sebastion and Madrid but none as good as these.
9212<>xx<>This place is as good as it gets in every respect
9213<>xx<>Jaleo is beautifully artistic with a trendy atmosphere.
9214<>xx<>You feel excited sitting there and wait in anticipation to try the food.
9215<>xx<>So here's the food breakdown  Selection of all cheeses   18.
9216<>xx<>Pasamontés  Manchego, Idiazábal, Murcia al vino, Garrotxa, Caña de cabra, La Peral       * Delicious!
9217<>xx<>Came with Fresh Raisens on the vine, dried apricots and roasted almonds ---  Jamón Ibérico de bellota 'Fermin' Cured ham from the legendary, acorn-fed,Black footed Ibérico pigs of Spain   22       * This was the best ham I've ever had.
9218<>xx<>And it had better be for over $5 a micro-thin slice.
9219<>xx<>All 5 pieces makes up one regular piece of bacon.
9220<>xx<>That's one expensive piece of bacon!
9221<>xx<>---  Ajo blanco con cangrejo Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes  12       * This definitely took a bit of getting used to.
9222<>xx<>I love vinegar, and that's a good thing considering that's exactly what this tasted like.
9223<>xx<>Vinegar with Cream with little bits of fresh lobster and grape halves.
9224<>xx<>---  Piquillo relleno de 'txangurro' Piquillo peppers stuffed with Dungeness crabmeat  14       * 2 pieces.
9225<>xx<>This was pretty hearty.
9226<>xx<>The peppers were nothing special but the sauce and crab were yummy.
9227<>xx<>---  Gambas al ajillo The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic  10       * 5-6 shrimp.
9228<>xx<>AWESOME!
9229<>xx<>Favorite so far  Trigueros con romesco Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce  12       * Nothing special.
9230<>xx<>5 spears of asparagus.
9231<>xx<>Plain sauce ---  Huevo frito con caviar A fried organic egg topped with caviar  16       * This just tasted like a poached egg that you dip bread into.
9232<>xx<>The caviar was so light you could not taste it unless you ate it seperately.
9233<>xx<>---  Carne asada con piquillos Julián de Lodosa Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit  14       * 7 slices, 3-4oz?
9234<>xx<>Again, nothing special.
9235<>xx<>Cooled perfectly.
9236<>xx<>---  Canelones tradicionales de cerdo, hígado de  pato y trufas con salsa bechamel Pork, foie gras and truffle canelones with bechamel sauce  14       * This was absoloutely my fav after the shrimp.
9237<>xx<>A bit salty but Mmm!
9238<>xx<>Warm and hearty, the truffle flavor standing out.
9239<>xx<>Delicious!
9240<>xx<>---  Lobster Paella 28       * Total disappointment.
9241<>xx<>The presentation was gorgeous, the Paella tasted like rice cooked in the juices of lobster, extremely salted.
9242<>xx<>We left more than half of it on the plate.
9243<>xx<>We ate the half tail and claw.
9244<>xx<>I really wanted to try the Sangria but they do not sell by the glass, another disappointment.
9245<>xx<>Overall it was fun, but you can have much better and cheaper food in NYC.
9246<>xx<>We came, we saw, we ate...and ate...and ate.
9247<>xx<>We arrived as a large party of 50 and the service we received matched that of a group of maybe 4 or 5.
9248<>xx<>The waitstaff was attentive and on top of things the entire evening.
9249<>xx<>As for the food, it was top notch.
9250<>xx<>We had a variety of tapas and dishes that had the entire group raving.
9251<>xx<>My favorites included the salt potatoes, garlic shrimp, snap pea salad and vegetarian paella which was served in a pan the size of a small car.
9252<>xx<>It was spicy, flavorful and worth a try.
9253<>xx<>From what I was told, the house Sangria was also a high point.
9254<>xx<>Overall, a fantastic spot in a fabulous hotel!
9255<>xx<>4.5     1 star for trying to scale and find this spot in the clusterfuck of the Cosmo in HIGH heels!!!!!
9256<>xx<>So I've been wanting to come to a Jose andres establishment for a long ass time!
9257<>xx<>We made last minute rsvps and they told us the place was booked by one party and if it was ok to dine in the "lounge" area.
9258<>xx<>Were like sure  no problem.
9259<>xx<>So we get to the Cosmo and this whole fuggin place is CF!
9260<>xx<>The valet area sucks because the signage confuses the ish out of you.
9261<>xx<>Anywho there was a concert going on and this meant more of a crowd than usual, im assuming.
9262<>xx<>Finally we found the place.
9263<>xx<>One thing im not feeling about these hotel eateries, is the feeling of being in some high end food court.
9264<>xx<>All these places next to eachother and you can people watch the hell of whats going on.
9265<>xx<>Its like a mall for real.
9266<>xx<>So tip toe over to the hostess desk and they tell us to wait a little and the wait was a little to much for me but the hostess was soooooooooo nice.
9267<>xx<>I must say the staff here are top notch!
9268<>xx<>When we were seated at first I was not feeling this area with straw type chairs and large wooden communal table.
9269<>xx<>It was so uncomfortable but it was what it was.
9270<>xx<>My inner prayers were answered because one of the lovely hostesses told me about the rich folks that booked the whole damn place were leaving YAY!
9271<>xx<>She walked us to our new table and walking there she said we were nice people, im thinking no you guys are!!!!
9272<>xx<>They were so nice and sweet.
9273<>xx<>The best hostesses I've ever encountered!
9274<>xx<>So now were in those comfy booths.
9275<>xx<>Im sippin on an adult shirley temple and pic a rum and coke with an ice ball.
9276<>xx<>We start scaling the menu and some of the things I wanted the PIC didn't , like the Bikini De Jamón Ibérico, Queso Manchego Y Trufas , he basically called that a ham sandwich and why should we get that LOL.
9277<>xx<>Ok find we didn't get it.
9278<>xx<>So we started with the goat cheese stuffed peppers.
9279<>xx<>Those were so BOMB but I wish they served 4 of those crack peppas instead of two.
9280<>xx<>Grrrrrrr.
9281<>xx<>Next dish was the veal cheek with these CRACK mashed potatoes.
9282<>xx<>The potatoes were like silk!
9283<>xx<>Not one lump.
9284<>xx<>Just velvet.
9285<>xx<>Ordered the garlic shrimp and those were tasty but didn't look like the pics I've seen of this dish but who cares this was good.
9286<>xx<>Next dish was this sausage mushroom stew type dish and that was tasty as well.
9287<>xx<>Very good sausage dish and I love mushrooms!!!!!
9288<>xx<>One dish that was a lil iffy was the fried chicken wings with this black ink moussey thing brushed around the inside of the dish.
9289<>xx<>That ink stuff was salty blah!
9290<>xx<>The fried chicken was good but not black peeps good hehe.
9291<>xx<>One downer is not being able to order the paella of your choice for a small party.
9292<>xx<>You can order what they're making that moment which sucked because I wanted the lobster paella!!!!
9293<>xx<>Not the chicken rabbit one!
9294<>xx<>Next time I'll show up with a party of 5 and Ill get that damn lobster paella!!!!!!!
9295<>xx<>We ended the night with the flan.
9296<>xx<>The BEST flan I've ever had NOM NOM NOM NOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
9297<>xx<>I don't want to share that next time :D Damned good and went well with my dessert wine!
9298<>xx<>I will be back here because I want to try more dishes and that amazing service!
9299<>xx<>I cannot rave enough about my absolutely FABULOUS experience at Jaleo!
9300<>xx<>I must admit, organizing a group dinner for about 20 people in a city I don't live in sounded like a daunting task once my boss placed that duty in my lap.
9301<>xx<>But I received phenomenal service from start to finish while planning and executing our business event at Jaleo, The Group Sales Staff at The Cosmopolitan were all very professional and organized, helping to ease the stress of pulling this whole dinner together in such a short amount of time.
9302<>xx<>A big, huge "thank you" shout out to both Kelly and Rose!
9303<>xx<>And another big round of applause goes out to our server at Jaleo: Mary!
9304<>xx<>She was fantastic and our whole group loved her.
9305<>xx<>Great service, delectable eats, tempting adult beverages, fun ambiance, and the perfect setting for a group.
9306<>xx<>I highly recommend this spot if you are planning a dinner in Vegas.
9307<>xx<>We went with a custom menu that the group sales team put together, and our guests were all very pleased with the 13 courses (yes, thirteen different menu items for everyone to try out) Tapas style of course, but such a great idea to give everyone a good idea of what this restaurant was all about.
9308<>xx<>The cocktails were flowing all night and food felt like it kept coming and coming!
9309<>xx<>Below are some of my favorites of the evening that you have to try if you are dining at Jaleo:  The Bramble- best cocktail of all time!
9310<>xx<>No for real, seriously amazing.
9311<>xx<>Cinnamon infused vodka with a cranberry puree.
9312<>xx<>Jamon Serrano Fermin- a perfectly flavored 18 month, salt cured Serrano Ham Endibias con queso - the cutest little app you've ever seen with endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds Gazpacho- this was served shooter-style and had some kind of amazing dollop of creamy cheese on top (not sure exactly what it was)  Croquetas de pollo - these little chicken fritters were delish.
9313<>xx<>Served in a shoe which I wasn't too sure about, but really tasty nonetheless Carne Asada- perfectly cooked and seasoned Paella- this traditional dish is an "absolute must" when dining at Jaleo!
9314<>xx<>They do some kind of crazy chant in the kitchen before these go out to the tables and it gets the whole restaurant excited.
9315<>xx<>They brought it out on this ginormous skillet that took two people to carry it just to show us what it was.
9316<>xx<>But then took it back over to the open kitchen to plate it for us.
9317<>xx<>Flan - typically not my favorite type of dessert because of the texture, but this flan was so creamy and I really enjoyed it.
9318<>xx<>Can't wait to come back to Jaleo!
9319<>xx<>And a big THANK YOU again to all the staff who helped me with the great execution of our group business dinner.
9320<>xx<>CHEERS!
9321<>xx<>Staying all week at the lovely Cosmopolitan Hotel and had a couple of really good meals (pool grille and China Poblano Chinese and Mexican place) before we gave what looked like an interesting menu a try at Jaleo.
9322<>xx<>Felt utterly exploited at Jaleo.
9323<>xx<>Overpriced plates for very mixed results, drink prices ($20) that would make a hip Manhattan bar sit up and take notice (for nothing special, I might add).
9324<>xx<>We're getting reimbursed and I still felt jerked around and exploited.
9325<>xx<>There are many better options within and nearby the hotel.
9326<>xx<>Exercise those options!
9327<>xx<>One bright light was the decor.
9328<>xx<>That and an eggplant and pepper salad that we paid a ton for for two bites each but was very tasty.
9329<>xx<>I came here to celebrate my new job after ice skating at Cosmo and wasn't sure what to expect.
9330<>xx<>It was the only place I could get a reservation at such short notice and nothing on the menu looked THAT amazing.
9331<>xx<>It was also a little pricier than I wanted.
9332<>xx<>While this sounds like the makings of a terrible review, I assure you, it was amazing.
9333<>xx<>Our awesome server Janie was extremely helpful and friendly.
9334<>xx<>She helped us pick out a few things- Croquetas De Pollo, Gambas Al Ajillo, and the Rossejat.
9335<>xx<>They came out in that order and each dish just got better.
9336<>xx<>While I wasn't crazy about the texture of the Rossejat, the flavor was great.
9337<>xx<>My friend and I split the flan for dessert and it was possibly the best flan I've ever had.
9338<>xx<>The sorbet that was served with it provided a great contrast of flavors and really complemented the dessert (as pretentious as that sounds, I can't find another way to describe it).
9339<>xx<>I also had an Open Table check which took $20 off the bill and the manager actually knew what it was and didn't hassle me.
9340<>xx<>Sweet!!
9341<>xx<>One of the best dinners I've had in a while.
9342<>xx<>I so want to give this place 5 stars.
9343<>xx<>Was highly recommended by a friend.
9344<>xx<>My expectations were high and the tapas did not disappoint.
9345<>xx<>The pan de cristal was sublime.
9346<>xx<>The manchego plate as well as the para negra was out of this world.
9347<>xx<>One dish after the other was well above my expectation.
9348<>xx<>We then decided to order the paella feast.
9349<>xx<>The beet gazpacho that came with it was to die for, while the salad was nothing to rave about.
9350<>xx<>But who cares?
9351<>xx<>Paella was to be the star of the show.
9352<>xx<>So we patiently waited and anticipated how great it would be only because the dishes that came before it were amazingly good.
9353<>xx<>After a 15 minute wait, it finally came.
9354<>xx<>It sadly ruined a meal that was supposed to be a perfect 10.
9355<>xx<>Half of the rice was burnt so bad that it was like eating bitter Rice Krispies.
9356<>xx<>The other half that was not burnt was so salty.
9357<>xx<>The combination of the two just made the dish incredibly inedible.
9358<>xx<>The chicken was also on the dry side.
9359<>xx<>So sad.
9360<>xx<>For a $29 per person paella feast, it was truly disappointing.
9361<>xx<>Would love to come back but most likely would just stick to tapas next time.
9362<>xx<>This is not a restaurant for good food, let alone good Tapas..
9363<>xx<>It is more for people watching.
9364<>xx<>Great ideas with presentation (tapas in a shoe??)
9365<>xx<>and seating, however the food was poor and the portions were very small.
9366<>xx<>The Paella for example was maybe 1 cup.
9367<>xx<>What happened to Paella being serve in the pan it was cooked in????
9368<>xx<>For the price you are paying there are so many other great choices in Vegas.
9369<>xx<>Sorry Jaelo...
9370<>xx<>I would give you no stars if I could.
9371<>xx<>Holy Moly Guacamole!!
9372<>xx<>I LOVE hot food, AND being indoors!!
9373<>xx<>This place has them BOTH!!
9374<>xx<>China De Mexico (as it's known to me and my friends) is hip, is hop, is what's happening!!
9375<>xx<>Now I've never eaten there, nor have I been, I'm on a fixed income and live very far away.
9376<>xx<>But I know what I like and I like China Poblano.
9377<>xx<>But if was able to eat there I think it would go a little something like this:  "Hello waiter, may I come indoor and order hot food?"
9378<>xx<>"Ce Senor, would you like the chop sticks?"
9379<>xx<>"Yes, my new best friend, I would."
9380<>xx<>And so on.
9381<>xx<>Writing this review to counter some of the low ratings, which surprised me after I had a positive experience with the restaurant.
9382<>xx<>Yes, prices are higher, but what else would one expect for Las Vegas, let alone a Jose Andres restaurant?
9383<>xx<>Be prepared to drop at least $60 for 2 people, but it does provide some unique dishes and ambiance that makes it worth going.
9384<>xx<>Went there when the brunch menu was up.
9385<>xx<>A rundown of some of the items we got: Barbacoa Taco-- the beef was soft, tender, and flavorful.
9386<>xx<>Cactus added a good texture.
9387<>xx<>Great taco choice.
9388<>xx<>Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich-- tiny and cute, but also very tasty.
9389<>xx<>Didn't know what to expect, but essentially a small circular pita-like bread and some braised pork put in the pocket.
9390<>xx<>Tender pork and fried bread=yum.
9391<>xx<>Carne Machaca-- probably the least impressive dish, the spicy sauce overpowered the whole dish and the beef cut into strips was chewy and dry, not very tasty.
9392<>xx<>I wouldn't recommend getting this... **Chilaquiles con Chorizo-- comes served in a small skillet, and DELICIOUS, hearty and filling.
9393<>xx<>Great balance of sauce, tortillas, chorizo, egg and CHEESE.
9394<>xx<>Seemingly simple, but the quality of ingredients makes a difference.
9395<>xx<>YUM.
9396<>xx<>If you go to brunch, I HIGHLY recommend getting this dish!!!
9397<>xx<>This dish made the trip worth it.
9398<>xx<>**Tres Lychees-- was originally debating between this or the mango sticky rice for dessert.
9399<>xx<>Definitely made the RIGHT choice in going with this!!
9400<>xx<>The lychee cake was topped with fresh lychees, lychee sorbet, and a rum foam.
9401<>xx<>The rum foam was a bit much, but the lychee sorbet was fantastic.
9402<>xx<>Lychee sorbet + lychee cake = best dessert choice, indeed.
9403<>xx<>**Best of the meal.
9404<>xx<>I would get these dishes over again.
9405<>xx<>Bam.
9406<>xx<>Very filling and tasty, and we had a very attentive server (Christin) who wasn't annoyed that we kept adding to our order as we continued (instead of ordering at once).
9407<>xx<>And the food came out in a timely manner.
9408<>xx<>Only mistake is that they gave us Chilaquiles when we hadn't ordered it, and they apologized and found the rightful customers.
9409<>xx<>But after seeing it, we decided to order it and was fantastic decision!
9410<>xx<>I'm grateful for the happy mistake.
9411<>xx<>First of all the prices are way too high, I ordered the Chinese taco, the oyster used on it (one only) was either canned, or long past due.
9412<>xx<>The rest was greasy and odd tasting.
9413<>xx<>The potatoes with mole where French fries with sweet mole.
9414<>xx<>And the lamb potstickers were still raw in the middle, the cumin doily they cooked with it knocked out ANY lamb flavor.
9415<>xx<>What a shame, the concept was good, the execution crappy.
9416<>xx<>We ended up coming here because Holstein's was too crowded and we didn't want to wait.
9417<>xx<>If everything here was 15% cheaper I would be giving it more stars, but the portions are really small for the price you pay.
9418<>xx<>Granted, I get that it's Vegas and everything is more expensive, but I don't think the food was THAT much better than other similarly priced restaurants.
9419<>xx<>With that said, I do think that the food was very good and I really enjoy the ambience of the restaurant.
9420<>xx<>I was at first a little weirded out by the Chinese/Mexican combo, but in reality the dishes aren't necessarily fusion dishes but half the menu is Chinese and half is Mexican, though there are little flourishes that would make it fusion.
9421<>xx<>There were 3 of us and we each got a taco and a main dish.
9422<>xx<>My taco had mushrooms and crispy pork skin in it, which was pretty good, and I also ordered a Mexican knife shredded noodle dish which had corn truffles and mushrooms.
9423<>xx<>It was very tasty.
9424<>xx<>My friends also ordered the Dan Dan mien which was very similar to traditional dan dan mien at a Chinese restaurant so I didn't see any fusion aspect to it, and we also ordered the steamed buns.
9425<>xx<>Located in The Cosmopolitan - I have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where I could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out.
9426<>xx<>Pork buns + Take out = Win!
9427<>xx<>(not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.)
9428<>xx<>Chinese cuisine + Mexican Cuisine = China Poblano.
9429<>xx<>I'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see.
9430<>xx<>Order consisted of:  When Pigs Fly (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88 Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00 Lychee Sour - yummy drink $12.00   So our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish.
9431<>xx<>The pork buns to me were correctly portioned, I split the order with a friend thankfully because she had ordered a single $10 Lobster Taco and $14 Tuna Ceviche.
9432<>xx<>The waitress really wasn't lying on small portions I give her credit for her honesty.
9433<>xx<>The food was overall pretty good.
9434<>xx<>I loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold.
9435<>xx<>My noodle dish was the kind of spicy I enjoy but I had to "pace" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (I didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?).
9436<>xx<>The lychee sour, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal.
9437<>xx<>It was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how I love lychee.
9438<>xx<>Overall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor.
9439<>xx<>Perhaps I'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given I could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.
9440<>xx<>So when the server tells you "We're not a fusion restaurant.
9441<>xx<>When you order your meals they come from separate kitchens" call me interested.
9442<>xx<>The food here is great.
9443<>xx<>Maybe I was starving, but it was very tasty.
9444<>xx<>I do regret not getting the queso dip (I think), dang table next to me was rubbing it in my face.
9445<>xx<>The dan dan noodles were good, nothing to write home about.
9446<>xx<>The chiqules (I butchered another dish name) was amazingly tasty.
9447<>xx<>Um the Pappas were delectable.
9448<>xx<>The 20 vegetable fried rice was also super yummy.
9449<>xx<>And for dessert, the tapioca pudding ball thing was great.
9450<>xx<>Me: really 20 vegetables?
9451<>xx<>Server: "I promise you that our fried rice has 20 different local and seasonal vegetables."
9452<>xx<>Here's the negative: price and size.
9453<>xx<>Me: Will this fill us up?
9454<>xx<>Server: "I always suggest each person order at least 4 items, think tapas."
9455<>xx<>That wouldn't be a big deal if everything wasn't $9 or more.
9456<>xx<>So in all, it is pricey (hey, its the strip) but totally worth trying if you don't mind "taking a mark" against yourself.
9457<>xx<>That's casino talk, right?
9458<>xx<>This is what food is about.
9459<>xx<>A perfect confluence of cultures and flavors.
9460<>xx<>Fresh, fast and varied.
9461<>xx<>The menu hits all the sweet spots while still being inventive.
9462<>xx<>Definitely order an item from each category: taco, dim sum and noodles.
9463<>xx<>Our favorites on this visits: Chilorio de Res (taco: short rib, Padilla negro, cumin, cilantro) and Dan Dan Mian ( wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce/peanuts).
9464<>xx<>The aesthetic of place: surreal mixture of Hispanic meets Asian.
9465<>xx<>Funky and fun like a street art house.
9466<>xx<>Come and enjoy...as we have, did and will Do.
9467<>xx<>I tried China Poblano for the first time on a Thursday night.
9468<>xx<>The menu sounded good but something stuck out right away.
9469<>xx<>It says in bold type at the top, "What brings Mexico and China together?
9470<>xx<>", and goes on to briefly answer this question.
9471<>xx<>Now, to me, it would seem there was an effort to blend the two cuisines.
9472<>xx<>However, looking over the menu I could see this was not the case, save a couple of dishes.
9473<>xx<>This isn't necessarily a bad thing but the menu intro suggests fusion when in reality it's more like co-habitation.
9474<>xx<>We sat at the bar where you can see the tortillas being made fresh constantly.
9475<>xx<>The ambiance was noisy but not over-bearing and the lack of a DJ certainly helped things unlike some other Cosmopolitan eatery that rhymes with Coal Screens.
9476<>xx<>The service was prompt and I felt the server was very good at explaining menu items that may have been spicy, contained raw foods, or were otherwise out of the ordinary.
9477<>xx<>I ordered a Carnitas taco and a Viva China taco.
9478<>xx<>The tortillas are about 6 inches in diameter and not overstuffed so be prepared for this before you go.
9479<>xx<>This is not Tacqueria (insert name here) that serves heaping piles of food with beans and rice on the side.
9480<>xx<>The tacos are served by themselves and any sides are extra.
9481<>xx<>That being said, the tacos I ordered were very good.
9482<>xx<>The Viva China taste is a bit dominated by the raw oyster.
9483<>xx<>The Carnitas taco was top notch.
9484<>xx<>Both tacos seemed a little on the greasy side but most of it was the sauce/salsa leaking out the bottom.
9485<>xx<>And now to the price.
9486<>xx<>Yes, this place is expensive compared to an actual street vendor but it's in a casino.
9487<>xx<>The menu is posted outside the restaurant and freely available online.
9488<>xx<>Do a little research ahead of time and you can decide for yourself if the price is fair.
9489<>xx<>China Poblano is great if you just need a quick bite to eat before a show or before heading out for the night.
9490<>xx<>The take out window is a nice amenity if you're just passing through and need a bit of sustenance.
9491<>xx<>I would not recommend China Poblano for a big meal simply because the a la carte nature of the menu can add up quickly.
9492<>xx<>You can easily spend $50 and still leave hungry.
9493<>xx<>I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise.
9494<>xx<>I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance!
9495<>xx<>We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas.
9496<>xx<>We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by.
9497<>xx<>I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes.
9498<>xx<>The shrimp mojo was incredible.
9499<>xx<>Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos.
9500<>xx<>The tuna ceviche was another winner.
9501<>xx<>Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty.
9502<>xx<>The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small.
9503<>xx<>Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing.
9504<>xx<>The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item.
9505<>xx<>They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them.
9506<>xx<>Overall service was very friendly.
9507<>xx<>Food was great.
9508<>xx<>It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented.
9509<>xx<>I would come back but I'd skip the buns!
9510<>xx<>yes yes and yes.
9511<>xx<>I have been CRAVING this place since eating here with my bf.
9512<>xx<>It is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile.
9513<>xx<>Jose Andres can do NO WRONG in my book.
9514<>xx<>Started our meals out with a few yummy cocktails.
9515<>xx<>I got the Margarita with a "salt air topping" wow.
9516<>xx<>I could have had 4 of these, but decided I actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained.
9517<>xx<>Its your typical Margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam.
9518<>xx<>Great presentation I may add.
9519<>xx<>We had no clue what to order so we ordered a few items to share.
9520<>xx<>We had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had Ensalada Gaspacho Estilo De Morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequín  Tuna Ceviche minus the pecans  Cctel De Camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado  Shrimp Mojo shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers   ....and the best thing ive ever eaten  20 vegetable with friend rice.
9521<>xx<>OMG.
9522<>xx<>this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth.
9523<>xx<>I cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...
9524<>xx<>This restaurant has a very interesting concept.
9525<>xx<>Asian Fusion meets Mexican.
9526<>xx<>I really enjoyed these two combined.
9527<>xx<>The service was impeccable, I wish I could remember my servers name but he was so awesome.
9528<>xx<>With so many restaurants in the Cosmo to choose from, I highly recommend trying this place.
9529<>xx<>We come to Vegas at least 3 times a year for the Magic Clothing trade show and try all the best food joints.
9530<>xx<>We got seated 50 minutes late and no one said sorry.
9531<>xx<>They said that they had run out of many of their best sellers.
9532<>xx<>We got talked in 3 average app's for $120 and we did not really want them.
9533<>xx<>The people that sat down after us got their food 20 minutes before us.
9534<>xx<>We got our food 90 minutes after we sat down.
9535<>xx<>The service was bad and the food was average.
9536<>xx<>They gave us 8 different excuses saying this is just the why things are at busy places.
9537<>xx<>At the end we went to the manager as it was our worst high end eating experience in Vegas and his looked at us like we were lucky to be at their "hip" hotel.
9538<>xx<>It was a sad experience and I am surprised that people like them.
9539<>xx<>It was the opposite experience they we had received at every other high end place in town.
9540<>xx<>This is only my 2nd yelp review and my first negative one.
9541<>xx<>This is the worst dining experience I have ever had from the service to the prices on the food.
9542<>xx<>The ambiance is nice as with most restaurants in the nicer hotels in Vegas but that's about the only positive thing I could say.
9543<>xx<>1.)
9544<>xx<>This was one of those places where there are lots of waiters running around but nobody seemed to be paying attention to us from the moment we sat down.
9545<>xx<>2.
9546<>xx<>)They call themselves a Greek restaurant but the only authentic dish we had was the tomato salad (which I actually really liked).
9547<>xx<>We ordered the baby broccoli but it was very bitter tasting, I couldn't even eat it!
9548<>xx<>Complained to one of the waiters but he kept making excuses for it and didn't even tell the head waiter.
9549<>xx<>A good restaurant with good service would notice that a dish was not eaten and would ask if there was a problem.
9550<>xx<>We asked the head waiter to take it off the bill and he reluctantly did but then made excuses for how it tasted again!
9551<>xx<>I don't care at that point, if it taste like crap, you should accommodate the customer.
9552<>xx<>3.)
9553<>xx<>When we sat down, the waiter asked if we wanted sparkling water and we said no, regular flat water is fine (assuming it would be tap water) but he never said "its bottled water, is that okay?"
9554<>xx<>So we get the bill and they charged us $24 for bottled water!
9555<>xx<>same thing with the broccoli, waiter made excuses for it but reluctantly took it off our bill.
9556<>xx<>4.)
9557<>xx<>We ordered the whole white fish which was market price but they never explained it the price was per pound!
9558<>xx<>the waiter proceeds to order us 4 pounds of fish!
9559<>xx<>I don't know anyone that eats a whole pound of fish by themselves.
9560<>xx<>We get our bill and the fish alone was $200 for 4 people!!!
9561<>xx<>You would have thought we were eating lobster and fillet Mignon.
9562<>xx<>This place is a total rip off with over priced menu items.
9563<>xx<>I live in San Francisco where we have some of the worlds best dining and have eaten at some of the best restaurants in Napa.
9564<>xx<>Those are real restaurants with longevity and good service.
9565<>xx<>This place is a typical Las Vegas hustle relying on tourists who are never going to eat there again.
9566<>xx<>Do not dine at this restaurant!
9567<>xx<>Horrible!
9568<>xx<>!
9569<>xx<>Pretty much every Cosmopolitan restaurant I have been to has not disappointed and the same goes for Estiatorio Milos.
9570<>xx<>We came here for lunch on our last day in Vegas and luckily got in right when they opened.
9571<>xx<>I didn't try the dinner but for lunch it is a fantastic deal.
9572<>xx<>For $22 you get three courses and it isn't your get one bite for each course three courses, it is a filling three courses.
9573<>xx<>I had the salmon bagel to start and my wife and parents all ordered the tomato salad.
9574<>xx<>The bagel was excellent and the salad was plentiful, filling and flavorful.
9575<>xx<>For the entree, we all ordered the Mediterranean sea bass.
9576<>xx<>The fish was plentiful and perfectly cooked.
9577<>xx<>For dessert we got some fresh fruit and greek yogurt.
9578<>xx<>The latter was so good, my wife decided she wanted to buy some when we got back home so off we went to Whole Foods.
9579<>xx<>If you're in Vegas and you're looking for a great deal, get this lunch special, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
9580<>xx<>Nothing significantly underwhelming about Milos, but a few quirks and I guess I just expected a little bit more...
9581<>xx<>The good: 1.
9582<>xx<>Went for the $20.11 lunch on a Friday which is definitely one of the best values on the Strip for a high-end meal.
9583<>xx<>2.
9584<>xx<>First* waitress gave detailed explanation of top dishes and seemed credible (advised that the salmon was nothing special and to get something else) 3.
9585<>xx<>Good food and surprisingly large portions.
9586<>xx<>-- Citrus/mint scallop appetizer was amazing but incredibly small (2 TINY scallops).
9587<>xx<>-- Lavraki (Mediterranean sea bass) was good.
9588<>xx<>-- Karidopita for dessert was very rich, but very good.
9589<>xx<>(Crushed walnuts and honey topped with ice cream)  The bad/odd: 1.
9590<>xx<>*Every point of contact was from someone else.
9591<>xx<>Our first waitress was great and helpful with recommendations, but then we never saw her again...
9592<>xx<>Someone else came to take our orders, another person for drinks, another to deliver food, another to check in on it, ... No one was bad, but the lack of continuity detracted from the quality of the service.
9593<>xx<>2.
9594<>xx<>My co-workers' lobster was severely undercooked in places.
9595<>xx<>3.
9596<>xx<>While ordering, one of the staff recommended a "can't miss" appetizer of fried eggplant and zucchini with tzatziki from off-the-menu.
9597<>xx<>We got it and it was okay, but then it ended up costing $30 (in line with the regular priced items, but 150% of the entire 3-course lunch!).
9598<>xx<>Felt kind of shady to push this so hard and have it end up being so expensive.
9599<>xx<>4.
9600<>xx<>Also got kind of an annoying vibe from the reservations call.
9601<>xx<>We called midweek to get a table at 12 on Friday.
9602<>xx<>We were told after being put on hold and getting transferred that we could "get squeezed in".
9603<>xx<>When we arrived we were the 2nd or 3rd table in the whole restaurant.
9604<>xx<>Although it filled up by the time we left after 1:30, still seemed like a bit of false press.
9605<>xx<>Adding to that, one of our 12 servers bragged that Milos was "the talk of the town" and he was stunned we had never been there... probably a bit of a hyperbole given that they are selling a $20 3-course lunch...
9606<>xx<>GREAT choice if you're staying at Cosmopolitan.
9607<>xx<>The prix fix lunch is an incredible value., especially after staying in the hotel for a few days and you start getting price fatigue from eating out constantly.
9608<>xx<>Ordered the scallop appetizer, which was perfectly prepared and not overcooked & tough.
9609<>xx<>Seabass entree was light, flavorful, and a generous portion, and asked for a side of tzatziki, which was delicious.
9610<>xx<>Topped it off w/ a the Greek yogurt dessert which was creamy and smooth, similar to panna cotta.
9611<>xx<>Loved everything about this place.
9612<>xx<>Fine dining w/o the sticker shock.
9613<>xx<>The GF and I arrived in Vegas on Thursday right at lunchtime.
9614<>xx<>Our room at the Cosmopolitan wasn't ready, so we decided to do some Greek for lunch at Estiatorio Milos.
9615<>xx<>Estiatorio Milos is on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and is a large space with balcony dining and what appears to be an actual in-house fish market that sells fresh Mediterranean fish to the public.
9616<>xx<>However, had we checked the Yelp reviews of the place prior to making our choice, we very likely would've chosen someplace else.
9617<>xx<>Thankfully, we didn't go elsewhere!
9618<>xx<>Most of the negative reviews for Estiatorio Milos cited poor customer service as it major flaw with lack of received value compared to cost as another concern.
9619<>xx<>However, most, if not all, of the poor reviews were for their dinner service.
9620<>xx<>Estiatorio Milos does lunch very well!
9621<>xx<>EM offers a three-course prix fixe lunch for $20.11.
9622<>xx<>I'm assuming the price will go up to $20.12 next year.
9623<>xx<>I started with the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus served with fava.
9624<>xx<>This selection has a $10 supplementary charge, but it was worth it!
9625<>xx<>The sashimi-grade octopus' tentacle was broiled to perfection leaving it nicely smoky, but still moist and amazingly tender without a hint of rubberiness or toughess.
9626<>xx<>It was cut into medallions that ranged from half-dollar to quarter sized pieces.
9627<>xx<>A great start to the meal!
9628<>xx<>Next, I chose the Lavraki with horta.
9629<>xx<>Lavraki is a Mediterranean seabass more commonly known as branzino.
9630<>xx<>The lavraki was grilled whole then de-boned prior to serving.
9631<>xx<>The fish possessed a delicate, but delicious flavor and was thankfully adorned only by capers, butter, a hint of salt, and flat-leaf parsley.
9632<>xx<>It was accompanied by horta, a sautéed swiss chard and spinach dish seasoned with lemon, olive oil and sea salt.
9633<>xx<>A great entrée!
9634<>xx<>For my dessert course, I had the Yogurt Martini.
9635<>xx<>It was lightly-sweetened Greek yogurt served in a martini glass.
9636<>xx<>It was the least memorable of the three courses.
9637<>xx<>I washed down my lunch with a glass of the Katsaros Chardonnay.
9638<>xx<>It wasn't overly oaky and possessed a nice clean finish.
9639<>xx<>It went very well with my lunch, but was a bit pricey in my mind at $16.
9640<>xx<>A team of servers provided our service.
9641<>xx<>They were friendly, attentive, and thorough throughout the meal.
9642<>xx<>One note:  EM was not crowded at all during our lunch visit.
9643<>xx<>Therefore, the server to diner ratio was definitely in their favor.
9644<>xx<>I can't speak to what EM brings to the table during their dinner service, but it definitely left a positive impression on my girlfriend and me for lunch.
9645<>xx<>It was a solid 4 to 4.5 star effort!
9646<>xx<>I recommend Estiatorio Milos for your lunchtime dining consideration.
9647<>xx<>3rd floor at The Cosmopolitan...a treasure trove.
9648<>xx<>Home to great restaurants (Milos, Jaleo, e by Jose Andres, and SECRET PIZZA) and a hot nightclub/dayclub (Marquee) with plenty of attractive drunk women nearby waiting to make a mistake (ie.
9649<>xx<>you).
9650<>xx<>Buffets are (in my opinion) a little overrated nowadays (with the exception of Wicked Spoon).
9651<>xx<>Milos offers up a great alternative that'll leave you satisfied and with a few bucks to spare.
9652<>xx<>Lunch special (3 courses):  - Price is equal to whatever year it is at the time: $20.12 - Charred Octopus ($10 supplement): Get this.
9653<>xx<>Cooked to perfection.
9654<>xx<>Had a nice salinity coming from the capers.
9655<>xx<>- Salmon: Cooked perfectly, light and buttery.
9656<>xx<>Served with long stem broccoli dressed with lemon, oil and salt.
9657<>xx<>- Walnut Cake: Interesting dessert.
9658<>xx<>Light and moist, perfectly textured, but you get huge undertones of ginger.
9659<>xx<>Might have enjoyed more if they just called it ginger cake.
9660<>xx<>Overall, great meal that didn't leave me feeling gross.
9661<>xx<>Can't help but think that this might be the best deal in Vegas.
9662<>xx<>Wonderful place, the $20.12 lunch deal was fantastic.
9663<>xx<>Great service and the food was very tasty.
9664<>xx<>We will be going back again.
9665<>xx<>10/3/2011 Dinner, GFand I.
9666<>xx<>It was not that spectacular, but It was convenience for us to have a dinner here at the hotel.
9667<>xx<>What we had was little, but did a lot of damages.
9668<>xx<>Appetizer: Octopus - $26 Grilled Mediterranean octopus with oregano, wild Santorini capers, apple vinegar & olive oil.
9669<>xx<>Serves two to four.
9670<>xx<>_ if you like burn/charcoal food this is it for you.
9671<>xx<>I'm not a big fan, but I was here for the wine.
9672<>xx<>Sweet: Chocolate cake not on the website menu, but it was good very chocolaty and smooth.
9673<>xx<>$16  Wine: I broke a glass and they bring me another one with additional half price on my bill.
9674<>xx<>However, it was fully filled second time around.
9675<>xx<>How nice I'm grad, I'm not driving to another hotel.
9676<>xx<>$25 me and $17 for my gf  Pro: Nice collection of wine from French to Napa.
9677<>xx<>Small selection of half bottles (3) I saw.
9678<>xx<>Con: No corkage fee, don't allow wine from outside in.
9679<>xx<>( I can under stand)  total: $84 + tips = $104
9680<>xx<>I believe this $20 lunch is a M-F steal of Las Vegas.
9681<>xx<>It's hard to imagine that for once, you are stealing from the Strip but it's true!
9682<>xx<>For $20, you get a 3 course meal that is fit for a Greek King.
9683<>xx<>Forget the app and dessert, the true star is the Mediterranean whole-grilled sea bass entree.
9684<>xx<>Nothing sings to me more than a beautifully filleted fish, grilled to perfection, with lemon salt-pepper and olive oil.
9685<>xx<>Pair it with a nice glass of Pinot Grigio, munch on some flame broiled home made bread and stare out from the incredible patio view and you realize from a local's perspective that this is why people LOVE LAS VEGAS!
9686<>xx<>This is definitely a new place to go to if you are tired of always getting Earls.
9687<>xx<>Especially after clubbing at Marquee, this is the perfect spot.
9688<>xx<>Although it is hidden, it's not too hard to find at all.
9689<>xx<>Located on the third floor through a hall way full of records.
9690<>xx<>If you look directly in the hall way you should see a TV and a pin ball machine.
9691<>xx<>They serve pizza by the slice or whole pizzas.
9692<>xx<>My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.
9693<>xx<>We got pepperoni, meat ball, sausage, ricotta cheese, and banana peppers on the side.
9694<>xx<>Cost was $29.
9695<>xx<>We took it outside and devoured it shortly.
9696<>xx<>Sitting next to the pool table on the couch.
9697<>xx<>We added crushed red peppers, parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.
9698<>xx<>It was so tasty and good.
9699<>xx<>Yes it's thin crust, and after pulling the slice apart, the cheese stretches and the toppings at the tip falls off.
9700<>xx<>Greasy but tasty, if grease is a problem you can use a napkin to dab at it.
9701<>xx<>This has now become a must come to spot every time we come to Vegas.
9702<>xx<>BOMBDOTCOM.
9703<>xx<>Enough said.
9704<>xx<>Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, in front of the Marquee exit.
9705<>xx<>My first bite of their white pizza was just... *BOOOOOM*.
9706<>xx<>Unexplainable, chees-y, garlic-y goodness.
9707<>xx<>The entrance, without any discernable signs, "could" be mistaken for a line to a bathroom.
9708<>xx<>But you cant really miss the club-goers carrying out their whole pie or eating a slice as they lounge on the sofas.
9709<>xx<>I mean.. come on.
9710<>xx<>Hence, the lines/wait can get a bit long.
9711<>xx<>Ever since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.
9712<>xx<>I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice.
9713<>xx<>It is safe to say I am HOOKED and hands-down my favorite pizza place in Vegas, or even LA for that matter.
9714<>xx<>(suggestions for great neapolitan pizzas in the greater LA area are welcome!!!!)
9715<>xx<>FYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.)
9716<>xx<>are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO.
9717<>xx<>The Salad is pretty good too so.. if there are any vegetarians/someone on a diet in the group.. well there you go.
9718<>xx<>and OMFG WTF I cannot believe I forgot about the peppers.
9719<>xx<>They have the best pickled peppers so you must ask them for some.. a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, omy~ YUMMMMMMM  I cannot wait to go back to Vegas!!
9720<>xx<>Good thing there are a ton of Bachelorette parties coming up.
9721<>xx<>:)
9722<>xx<>Super cool guys!!
9723<>xx<>Perfect hangover food!!
9724<>xx<>I love when the bottom of the pie is crispy but not burnt.
9725<>xx<>Delish!
9726<>xx<>!
9727<>xx<>Secret Pizza it is!
9728<>xx<>All I know is I see tons of people sitting around the middle of a casino with labeless pizza boxes at 2am.
9729<>xx<>After a very brief attempt, my friends and I finally asked and was directed to this random hall that led to the tiny secret pizza place.
9730<>xx<>You can buy by the slice or whole pie.
9731<>xx<>They run efficiently and take your order fast but expect a short line and wait as they reheat your pizza in the oven as it has gotten cold sitting out in display.
9732<>xx<>They have about 4 kinds of pizza, all NY style so very thin crust and slice but very delicious.
9733<>xx<>A little high price for pizza in general, but practically free by Vegas restaurant means.
9734<>xx<>FYI, there are about 5 bar stools and no where else to sit.
9735<>xx<>It is a true pizza joint, buy your pie and get out.
9736<>xx<>After hanging out at the Chandelier bar my friend Ashley was wanting a soda.
9737<>xx<>Not knowing where to get one at almost 3am, she said to follow her, after going up a couple of escalators and down a narrow hallway the smell of pizza hit me in the face.
9738<>xx<>OMG there is a hidden pizzeria in the hotel!!
9739<>xx<>Not only does this place have no name, you'll find no signage, and no menu.
9740<>xx<>It's a very no nonsense New York-style pizza counter.
9741<>xx<>To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up.
9742<>xx<>This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter).
9743<>xx<>You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices.
9744<>xx<>Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me.
9745<>xx<>All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!!
9746<>xx<>Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there).
9747<>xx<>That rootbeer was the best i have had in a long time.
9748<>xx<>Make sure you save your change because they have a classic pinball machine there too!
9749<>xx<>!
9750<>xx<>Place is good because it is fast, good, and hits the spot.
9751<>xx<>I recommend going here after the clubs to get some carbs in you!
9752<>xx<>Tips: If you go after you come out of Marquee the lines can be pretty long so you may be better
9753<>xx<>I'll admit it.
9754<>xx<>I found this place, but I had to cheat by reading Yelp reviews (thanks guys).
9755<>xx<>Also, it's between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo.
9756<>xx<>:p  The NY look definitely brought back memories of my trip to New York from last year.
9757<>xx<>The prices for the pizza are rather expensive for a New York style pizza, but I figured it had to be adjusted for Las Vegas, so that's understandable.
9758<>xx<>With that said, I was fine with it, really.
9759<>xx<>I grabbed a slice of the White Pizza, and it was delicious.
9760<>xx<>Oily, but still great.
9761<>xx<>Luckily there was a small line, so the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be on a week night.
9762<>xx<>Overall though, it's perfectly acceptable for late night pizza, especially when under the influence of alcohol.
9763<>xx<>I love pizza!
9764<>xx<>And this place is not somewhere I'd like to come back to.
9765<>xx<>First of all, this place should change their $ to $$ because for 3 slices of pizza, 1 soda and 1 beer, it was $30!!!
9766<>xx<>Insane, right?
9767<>xx<>I wouldn't mind paying if the quality was there.
9768<>xx<>But unfortunately, it wasn't.
9769<>xx<>I love the concept of it being a secret and the fun is finding it.
9770<>xx<>But once we found it, I was expecting to be rewarded with some great pizza.
9771<>xx<>Pizza was salty and a little brunt.
9772<>xx<>The ingredients felt short in quality and quantity.
9773<>xx<>I hate to say this but I would have been more satisfied and happy having Costco pizza.
9774<>xx<>Secret pizza, you need to start serving better pizzas with better ingredients or just stay a secret but this is one secret no one wants to know about.
9775<>xx<>Happy eating everyone :)
9776<>xx<>Oh I love Secret Pizza, especially after a long night of dancing at Club Marquee.
9777<>xx<>Ironic that the place is called Secret Pizza, because if the line at 3am is any indication, someone just told everyone about this place.
9778<>xx<>Luckily, both times I went we beat the rush... or should I say set the trend (since a huge line formed right behind us both times hehe).
9779<>xx<>I've had two types of pizza here the White Pizza and two item combo of Sausage and Pepperoni.
9780<>xx<>The White Pizza is my fave, its toppped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and we usually add sausage to it.
9781<>xx<>I like how there is absolutely no advertisement of the place on the Cosmopolitan website.
9782<>xx<>But I guess they try to keep it a secret for those who have yet to find it.
9783<>xx<>I have to admit, it was quite an accomplishment when we stumbled upon secret pizza.
9784<>xx<>Shhh it's a secret.
9785<>xx<>That's what all the staff members at MGM said when we asked where Secret Pizza was.
9786<>xx<>The pizzas are pretty big and affordable.
9787<>xx<>I think they're about $5 a slice but the slices are pretty big.
9788<>xx<>They have your normal everyday toppings such as truffle cheese, pepperoni, etc.
9789<>xx<>Swing by here if you're hungry and don't want to spend too much at a fancy restaurant.
9790<>xx<>Incredible food and drinks, very loud and table service mediocre at best.
9791<>xx<>Not bad enough to not to warrant a second visit.
9792<>xx<>I'll give it another try...
9793<>xx<>My girlfriend put it best, "We should've went to Taco Bell.
9794<>xx<>Of course Citizen Public House is better quality than Taco Bell...
9795<>xx<>But not by much.
9796<>xx<>And it's 10% the price."
9797<>xx<>This place never ceases to amaze me.
9798<>xx<>The staff, service and food was incredible.
9799<>xx<>Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem.
9800<>xx<>Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready.
9801<>xx<>We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem.
9802<>xx<>Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!!
9803<>xx<>CPH not a problem.
9804<>xx<>An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content.
9805<>xx<>The food was fabulous!
9806<>xx<>I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu.
9807<>xx<>We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious!
9808<>xx<>Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent!
9809<>xx<>Everything was absolutely delicious.
9810<>xx<>Back to the staff & service, I have to say were all fabulous and so accommodating.
9811<>xx<>Bravo!
9812<>xx<>I can't wait to bring new friends to experience this place ......and I promise we won't be PITA's.
9813<>xx<>We had a great experience here.
9814<>xx<>First, a great bartender while we waited for our table.
9815<>xx<>After seated, the great service continued.
9816<>xx<>Our server was one of the best.
9817<>xx<>We made sure to share this with his manager who was also great.
9818<>xx<>Food: scallops were excellent.
9819<>xx<>So was the meatloaf.
9820<>xx<>I highly recommend this place!
9821<>xx<>I will return if I'm in the area again.
9822<>xx<>Where to start?
9823<>xx<>Lex is the manager and really helped me out for Valentines night.
9824<>xx<>He put my preordered roses on our table and brought over our bottle of wine that I preordered.
9825<>xx<>Our waiter was very cool and knowledgable.
9826<>xx<>Atmosphere was great and very clean.
9827<>xx<>My steak was amazing!
9828<>xx<>Couldn't have been better.
9829<>xx<>My wife's chicken however was not the same.
9830<>xx<>Her chicken breast was very dry.
9831<>xx<>We didn't say anything because we were not looking to stir things up on a great night.
9832<>xx<>The dessert was amazing and you have to try it no matter how full you are.
9833<>xx<>That's on point.
9834<>xx<>So for the price we paid, that was the sad part.
9835<>xx<>I'm going to email Lex to let him know and I'm sure they will fix the problem.
9836<>xx<>Good but not great food, drinks are 4 oz / $10 - tasty but disappointing, great atmosphere, trendy food, the chopped salad was good!
9837<>xx<>!
9838<>xx<>I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, husband agreed.
9839<>xx<>The service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great.
9840<>xx<>Their chopped salad really is something special.
9841<>xx<>But, I was quite disappointed in receiving 3 medium size scallops for dinner.
9842<>xx<>And I didn't find the other dishes I tasted great.
9843<>xx<>For the money, I just can't rate the food any better than this.
9844<>xx<>fun environment and menu.
9845<>xx<>food and service was, meh....just ok. drinks weren't as strong as what we paid for.
9846<>xx<>Had a great evening here!!
9847<>xx<>We ended up getting a couple starters to share - eggplant burrata, chopped salad and baked brown sugar gnocchi.
9848<>xx<>They were all amazing but especially loved the burrata.
9849<>xx<>Drinks were great!
9850<>xx<>Very fresh, didn't skimp on the alcohol and tasted fantastic.
9851<>xx<>Service was the best part!
9852<>xx<>Our waiter was very attentive and many staff members checked on us to make sure our meal was perfect.
9853<>xx<>Thanks!
9854<>xx<>After choosing this place after it's great reviews, I decided to give it a try.
9855<>xx<>Not gonna lie, I was a little let down by the menu choices, but what I had (crab cakes & chopped salad) was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
9856<>xx<>Definitely worth the bite!
9857<>xx<>:)
9858<>xx<>We ordered the swordfish, chicken pasta, hummus and daily soup (loaded baked potato).
9859<>xx<>Soup was uninspiring but the hummus was loaded with tomatoes and artichokes was tasty.
9860<>xx<>The swordfish was delicious, but didn't come with much else.
9861<>xx<>The chicken pasta was good, but too simple for the price.
9862<>xx<>I'm not from Tuscon, but I was expecting more from a restaurant located downtown for the prices.
9863<>xx<>Go for the drinks though.
9864<>xx<>The old fashioned is good and strong and worth the price.
9865<>xx<>The polish fix is strong but less bitter flavor.
9866<>xx<>Wow I took a friend here for his birthday it was amazing service and great food!!
9867<>xx<>The warm peanut butter mouse with chocolate gelato was amazing!!
9868<>xx<>A party in your mouth!
9869<>xx<>After weeks of going back and forth, back and forth and checking tons of reviews, we decided to go check out the Arrogant Butcher ourselves.
9870<>xx<>The reviews on here (Yelp!)
9871<>xx<>were kinda all over the place so we weren't sure what to expect.
9872<>xx<>Any-who, we came to the conclusion that:   1.
9873<>xx<>The decor is pretty darn awesome.
9874<>xx<>2.
9875<>xx<>The waitstaff was good.
9876<>xx<>The place was fully staffed and timing on everything was good.
9877<>xx<>3.
9878<>xx<>Reservations may not be such a bad idea.
9879<>xx<>We made one at six and it was pretty dead in there when we arrived.
9880<>xx<>However, by the time we left around 7:15, it was full.
9881<>xx<>We went on a Saturday (no games of any sort going on downtown either).
9882<>xx<>4.
9883<>xx<>WAY overpriced.
9884<>xx<>Our breakdown: 3 cocktails, an appetizer, 3 mussels...$1 a pop, an entree (we split it) and 2 desserts = $100 without tip.
9885<>xx<>5.
9886<>xx<>Filet was not worth it.
9887<>xx<>At $29 bucks, you would expect something much more.
9888<>xx<>It was overcooked and while the menu made it sound like it came with potatoes, it was more or less a small amount of pureed/creamed potatoes.
9889<>xx<>6.
9890<>xx<>Drinks, appetizers and desserts were all awesome.
9891<>xx<>Final thought: We will be back....but for drinks and appetizers during happy hour which runs from 3-6 Mon-Sat (they are closed Sundays).
9892<>xx<>Went there on 11/10, had the hummus appetizer, it was really good!!
9893<>xx<>Then we ordered the Pretzel bread and cheese fondue, OMG is was the bomb!!
9894<>xx<>Service was excellent!
9895<>xx<>I had Fish and Chips, it was good but a bit salty!
9896<>xx<>My friend Sweet Potato Tortelli, she said it was awesome!
9897<>xx<>Next time we go to an event downtown, we will go back.
9898<>xx<>What a great place!
9899<>xx<>Love the food and the atmosphere!
9900<>xx<>I was in last Friday and although it was packed due to Phoenix Comicon, a Dbacks game, the Phoeinix Symphony and first Friday...  We got a table in the bar, had attentive service and made it out just in time to make it to the Phoenix Symphony for our show!
9901<>xx<>My boyfriend and I went in yesterday to enjoy some drinks and appetizers for the afternoon and had a wonderful time again!
9902<>xx<>Lauren was our server and she was fabulous!
9903<>xx<>Again attentive and made sure we had everything we needed!
9904<>xx<>I will definitely be back!
9905<>xx<>The hubs and I went to AB last weekend for dinner.
9906<>xx<>The food is ah-mazing!
9907<>xx<>We sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails.
9908<>xx<>The service was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.
9909<>xx<>He had the short rib stew.....OMG!
9910<>xx<>if you like stew, this is the one for you.
9911<>xx<>It's almost like a chili verde as there was a delicious green chili flavor.
9912<>xx<>It came with a corn muffin that was a nice compliment to the stew.
9913<>xx<>I had the seared scallops plate.
9914<>xx<>The scallops were cooked perfectly; "succulent" is the word that comes to mind (I never use that word!).
9915<>xx<>For dessert, we HAD to have the butterscotch pudding....and yes, it is as good as everyone says it is!!
9916<>xx<>We'll be back...
9917<>xx<>Started off with the pretzels and cheese and fritters.
9918<>xx<>Both were great!
9919<>xx<>Then for the main course I had the turkey sloppy joe which consisted of ground turkey, pablano pepper and pepperjack cheese on a homemade bun... Amazing!
9920<>xx<>And I topped that off with the blueberry cheesecake for dessert (YUM!!!).
9921<>xx<>Overall great food and a very good experience.
9922<>xx<>The little lady and I have been to the Arrogant Butcher countless times, it is one of our downtown standbys that we visit time and time again.
9923<>xx<>Usually we go for happy hour, but this time we went for a basic dinner.
9924<>xx<>Some family was in town for the holidays, and wanted to try something new.
9925<>xx<>We suggested one of the two new great pizza places downtown, not thinking that some places are closed on a Monday night.
9926<>xx<>After getting downtown and paying $10 for parking (there was a Suns game), we realized our mistake.
9927<>xx<>Luckily just steps away The Arrogant Butcher saved the day.
9928<>xx<>We started our meal for six with pretzels (one of our favorites), oysters (we have been told by an insider that they are flown in daily, and the quality backs it up), and hummus.
9929<>xx<>All were excellent and quickly devoured by the table.
9930<>xx<>For entrees, our group chose the pork chops, two orders of the short rib stew, the scallops, the crap stuffed chicken and the chicken stroganoff.
9931<>xx<>I had previously thought the stew was the best thing on AB's menu, but I had never had the pork chops before.
9932<>xx<>I may have to reevaluate that ranking.
9933<>xx<>The chops were moist and flavorful.
9934<>xx<>They had a breading on them that was crunchy and done really well.
9935<>xx<>Paired with the mashed taters and veggies, this dish was epic.
9936<>xx<>The stew has a nice little kick and is served with a slice of cornbread, both dishes are amazing.
9937<>xx<>The pairing with the scallops was a little weird (I don't get the whole brussels sprouts thing yet), but they were cooked well and tasty.
9938<>xx<>We have had the scallops in the past which were prepared differently, and we thought they were great.
9939<>xx<>I was told the crab to chicken ratio was a little off, but the dish was good otherwise.
9940<>xx<>I didn't taste it myself though to verify.
9941<>xx<>All in all, a great experience as always, great food, great service.
9942<>xx<>They did well and impressed our out of town guests.
9943<>xx<>What I Ate - House soft pretzels and provolone fondue - Sweet potato tortelli - Grilled asparagus  Would I Go Again?
9944<>xx<>The word I would use to describe this restaurant's food is "bold."
9945<>xx<>The sweet potato tortelli was fantastic--very strong sweet and salty flavors.
9946<>xx<>The portion was kind of small, for which I was grateful.
9947<>xx<>The flavors were so "bold" that I don't think I could've eaten any more.
9948<>xx<>The grilled asparagus were great--again, very "bold" flavor with olive oil and vinegar.
9949<>xx<>Lastly, the soft pretzel bites and provolone fondue were outstanding!
9950<>xx<>If only my soft pretzel at ballgames tasted like these pretzel bites and the cheese dip like this provolone fondue!
9951<>xx<>The Arrogant Butcher was great, and I would like to come back next time I am in Phoenix.
9952<>xx<>Had a excellent lunch here today.
9953<>xx<>I ordered the shortrib stew and it was wonderful.
9954<>xx<>My gf ordered a bowl of potato soup and a cheese/bread combo, she was pleased also.
9955<>xx<>Really good food.
9956<>xx<>Excellent service.
9957<>xx<>Reasonable prices for a place on the Strip.
9958<>xx<>We were a party of 9 people total, including three 4 y/o boys.
9959<>xx<>We took the short walk over from the Bellagio for some breakfast on a weekday.
9960<>xx<>There was no wait at that early hour.
9961<>xx<>The server was excellent, just all around pleasant, friendly, and got our orders correct and out in good time.
9962<>xx<>She was just the right amount of attentive without hovering and went the extra mile to make sure we were all happy.
9963<>xx<>(Can't recall her name, but she was a blond young lady with an accent.
9964<>xx<>Management, if you're reading, know that she's an awesome employee!)
9965<>xx<>It was very family-friendly at this time of day, and it was one of the best mealtime experiences our group had during our Vegas vacation.
9966<>xx<>Also, the candy shop/sweets area was neat to walk through and get a treat to-go.
9967<>xx<>Would definitely go back next time we're in town.
9968<>xx<>I've dined here only once and found my overall experience to be... Good.
9969<>xx<>Nothing spectacular, but it was good.
9970<>xx<>I had the BBQ chicken pizza and thought it was just okay.
9971<>xx<>If I were to return, I'd definitely look to try something else.
9972<>xx<>Their specialty is really the assortment of drinks they offer.
9973<>xx<>We had the gummy bear drink which tasted really good.
9974<>xx<>I hate the taste of alcohol, but I actually really enjoyed this drink.
9975<>xx<>The ambiance is great for a party or a girls night.
9976<>xx<>I would probably return just for the cocktails.
9977<>xx<>We ended up here because the outdoor Parisian cafe was packed and the line was out onto the street to wait.
9978<>xx<>This place was right next to it.
9979<>xx<>We were told it would be a 20+ minute wait for a table outside.
9980<>xx<>We sat at the bar and got a drink and coffee while we waited and it took about 15 minutes to get a table.
9981<>xx<>The Bloody Mary was fantastic--they make their own spicy infused vodka (but then used a generic BM mix??)
9982<>xx<>and while it tasted fantastic, they were super stingey on the alcohol.
9983<>xx<>Zero buzz achieved (and I'm a lightweight).
9984<>xx<>Their coffee is AMAZING.
9985<>xx<>So amazing we asked what brand they use because we wanted to buy some.
9986<>xx<>No one knew.
9987<>xx<>So that was a bummer.
9988<>xx<>The food was decent and middle of the road in cost.
9989<>xx<>Not as expensive as other places but not cheap either.
9990<>xx<>If you go, try and sit outside on the patio.
9991<>xx<>This review is only for the Lollipop Passionfruit Gobblet.
9992<>xx<>After a recommendation from a co-worker, I decided that I must try one of their gobblet drinks when I drop by Vegas.
9993<>xx<>My husband and I ordered the Lollipop Passionfruit Gobblet to share.
9994<>xx<>The drink was huge but it wasn't cold at all (even with so much ice in the glass).
9995<>xx<>The flavors were nice but it's not something that I would keep ordering in the future.
9996<>xx<>Our waitress was ok, but she forgot the water that I've asked for.
9997<>xx<>I had to ask her a couple times before I got my water.
9998<>xx<>Overall, it's a decent place for drinks but I would prefer my drink to be cold since I'm in a hot desert.
9999<>xx<>This place was a must stop on my trip to Vegas...
10000<>xx<>I expected the prices since it was Vegas and the celebs that have been seen in the place but my complaint was the tables are really small for two ppl.. Me and my bf ordered a fondue plate, two martinis and a goblet drink and the table was stuffed and we had to miniver the table the whole time...
10001<>xx<>The only other thing was the waiter came back to often, polite but to often...
10002<>xx<>This was deff a one time thing for me..
10003<>xx<>But I am glad I can say I went...
10004<>xx<>I reviewed this place once before.
10005<>xx<>I gave it an excellent rating.
10006<>xx<>It was soooo good we wanted to go back.
10007<>xx<>We got a groupon and made a date night out of it.
10008<>xx<>It's under new ownership.
10009<>xx<>Half of the things on the menu that used to be there are GONE!
10010<>xx<>The things remaining are changed and they are BAD.
10011<>xx<>I had baked macaroni and cheese (cause I am really a 10 year old trapped in a 40 year old) and it was gooey and creamy and cheesy last time.
10012<>xx<>What I had tonight was not something I'd bother to fight traffic on the strip for.
10013<>xx<>And hey throwing stale Ritz crackers on top of microwaved Mac and cheese isn't fooling me into thinking its baked!
10014<>xx<>Disgusting.
10015<>xx<>My handsome partner in crime had sliders and the buns were burnt and he had pork sliders(??)
10016<>xx<>anyway they deep fry those and include sauerkraut inside them.
10017<>xx<>More disgustingness.
10018<>xx<>He couldn't stomach the deep fried bun, I tried it, it's like a bland flavorless donut.
10019<>xx<>Basically this place has diner food with swanky food prices.
10020<>xx<>$18 for a pizza.
10021<>xx<>$22 for meatloaf.
10022<>xx<>$18.00 for a burger.
10023<>xx<>$17.00 for Mac and cheese.
10024<>xx<>Dessert ranges from $10.00 to $50.00.
10025<>xx<>The service was not terrific.
10026<>xx<>The bill comes with the math for you.
10027<>xx<>We left 20% because its Christmas time otherwise we'd have left 10%.
10028<>xx<>And it was an empty Monday night...  My advice is, if you've been here before treasure your memories don't go back.
10029<>xx<>If you are thinking about coming here for a first time, keep on thinking and move along!
10030<>xx<>TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY
10031<>xx<>I have been hearing about this place for quite some time now...how great their desserts are and about all the celebrity sightings.
10032<>xx<>Since I had family in town, I decided to give it a try.
10033<>xx<>We had a great server.
10034<>xx<>I believe her name is Heather.
10035<>xx<>She was very attentive and friendly.
10036<>xx<>We ordered various sandwiches and pasta dishes.
10037<>xx<>All the dishes we ordered were pretty good, not phenomenal, but pretty good.
10038<>xx<>Yup, we tend to try one another's food.
10039<>xx<>I ordered a fluffer nutter milkshake which I enjoyed thorougly.
10040<>xx<>It was extremely thick.
10041<>xx<>I tasted more peanut butter then fluff.
10042<>xx<>I would have to say I like fluff better.
10043<>xx<>We perused the candy store as well.
10044<>xx<>The couture lollipops were pretty to look at but at $25 dollars I decided to pass.
10045<>xx<>I'm pretty sure I'll come back as I need constant sweets for my sweet tooth.
10046<>xx<>Plus, this place is open very late.
10047<>xx<>As with anything in Las Vegas, if I'm paying the high prices along the strip, I expect to be pretty impressed.
10048<>xx<>But eating brunch at the Sugar Factory was just plain meh.
10049<>xx<>I will admit, we were kind of in a hurry so we didn't have time to really study the menu (or yelp reviews) to decide what would be really outstanding, we just picked the first thing on the menu that sounded good and ordered standard mimosas.
10050<>xx<>We did notice while waiting for our food that every single table around us had ordered these large fishbowl drinks with gummy candy on top and dry ice bubbling out of them, so we must have missed out on that experience because it was clear that was *the* thing to order.
10051<>xx<>The brunch food was simply unexceptional.
10052<>xx<>I felt like I could have gotten the same quality at a diner for 1/3 the price.
10053<>xx<>I might come back for just drinks or dessert since that seems to be their specialty, but not again for a full meal.
10054<>xx<>We went in knowing it would be expensive but I had no idea the quality would be so.... Well, shitty.
10055<>xx<>We ordered the popcorn shrimp, Mediterranean pasta & cotton candy Cosmo, and sexual chocolate.
10056<>xx<>The popcorn shrimp was greasy and the breading was flavorless and had a flour taste to it.
10057<>xx<>The Mediterranean pasta was mediocre.
10058<>xx<>It had feta, spinach, tomato, kalimata olives, in a lemon sauce... Oh and butter.
10059<>xx<>I know this bc there was a spoonful of it unmelted that I took down because I thought it was cheese.
10060<>xx<>I could have barfed.
10061<>xx<>I also ordered garlic bread and it was charged and didn't come out with my meal.
10062<>xx<>The drinks however were great.
10063<>xx<>I'd go back for this and this alone.
10064<>xx<>Maybe we chose the wrong thing on the menu but some simple things were overlooked like warming the Dish enough to have the ingredients melted and flavor???
10065<>xx<>For 90 bucks I'd rather have gone next door to gordan Ramsey's steak.
10066<>xx<>I might give it another shot .....
10067<>xx<>But will likely be drinking only.
10068<>xx<>I visited this place with two friends for dinner.
10069<>xx<>I got the steak sandwich with a side of fries, one friend got the steak frites and the other got a burger.
10070<>xx<>As for my steak sandwich, I thought the steak was bland and the fries were alright, nothing spectacular.
10071<>xx<>Although my friends liked their food more than me, including the Swedish fish drink that he said he enjoyed, we didn't order desserts, which is what this place is known for.
10072<>xx<>There ended up being a long wait due to a convention in town and game on tv that just never seemed to end.
10073<>xx<>But once we were seated we had a good service by our first waitress.
10074<>xx<>She was very on top of it and got our orders in quickly.
10075<>xx<>When her shift ended she introduced us to our new waiter.
10076<>xx<>He seemed friendly but our service dropped off tremendously with the switch.
10077<>xx<>When we were done and asked for the check it was probably 10 minutes before he brought it and and 20 minutes till he finally cashed us out and brought it back to us.
10078<>xx<>We had split the check (3 ways) there were some errors but since he was so slow we settled the difference between ourselves.
10079<>xx<>The upside is my glass had a crack in it which I hadn't noticed till near the end, when  a different server noticed it she came over and asked if it was cracked, then took it away and brought me a brand new drink!
10080<>xx<>Good food, good beer and good service.
10081<>xx<>We were told to go here by two drunk Irish folks we met at another bar, so I guess if they say it's good, it's good.
10082<>xx<>My husband had one of the specials of the day which included a HUGE corned beef sandwich in a bbq type sauce.
10083<>xx<>It was huge, and apparently delicious.
10084<>xx<>I had the smoked salmon RLT (including irish bacon, smoked salmon, lettuce and tomato) which was simply amazing.
10085<>xx<>I had a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which were also great.
10086<>xx<>Our bartenders were knowledgeable about all the Irish beers and even got me to try something I normally never would - Guinness Black Label.
10087<>xx<>And I had 2.
10088<>xx<>Great selection of Irish beers on tap and in bottle, and some American beers on draught too.
10089<>xx<>So glad we decided to head on in.
10090<>xx<>It was well worth the money.
10091<>xx<>We'll be back!
10092<>xx<>What a fun venue!!
10093<>xx<>Great food, try the fries and curry appetizer.
10094<>xx<>Fish and chips, shepherds pie and bangers and mash were our favorite.
10095<>xx<>We were greeted with a ton of Irish charm, but our waitress Sara made the evening a blast!
10096<>xx<>She knew just want to recommend and attended to everything with an amazing smile!
10097<>xx<>Visit here and enjoy the ambiance, the great food and drink and finish with one if their amazing selections of Irish based whiskey.
10098<>xx<>Great selection!
10099<>xx<>Cheers!
10100<>xx<>I love Irish pubs and have visited my fair share.
10101<>xx<>This one is definitely, one of the best.
10102<>xx<>Probably the worst part of Rí Rá, is it's location.
10103<>xx<>You might even miss it, walking by.
10104<>xx<>Over the years, their biggest competitor (Nine Fine Irishmen, at NYNY) has slowly fallen out of favor with me.
10105<>xx<>In fact, the ONLY thing I think Nine Fine has the upper leg on, anymore, is the decor, and that's only because it's two levels vs. Rí Rá's one.
10106<>xx<>The facade is in the Mandalay Bay/Luxor mall, which is known as Mandalay Place.
10107<>xx<>It's a rather small entry and doesn't offer a very good view of the interior.
10108<>xx<>Once inside, it's a well apportioned Irish Pub with plenty of traditional decor and very dark tones.
10109<>xx<>I like my pubs dark, this one nailed it.
10110<>xx<>It's a rather long and narrow restaurant with a bar on one side and booths on the other.
10111<>xx<>As with any good pub, you can get food at the bar, and typically better service and conversation.
10112<>xx<>We happened into this place on a Saturday morning and tried a couple items from the brunch menu.
10113<>xx<>I had the Irish eggs benedict.
10114<>xx<>They were poached eggs on potato cakes, rashers, with sauce and a side of hash brown potatoes.
10115<>xx<>The only thing I can find wrong, was the eggs were overcooked.
10116<>xx<>Poached eggs should be runny and they were past that point.
10117<>xx<>Everything else was perfect.
10118<>xx<>It was a lot of potato, but that's Irish food and I like it.
10119<>xx<>Especially good for nursing a hangover.
10120<>xx<>My wife had the corned beef sandwich with curry chips.
10121<>xx<>Chips, of course, being what Americans call fries.
10122<>xx<>Excellent with the curry sauce.
10123<>xx<>When we saw it on the menu, we knew it would be a winner.
10124<>xx<>They had the proper condiments, including malt vinegar and HP sauce available on the bar.
10125<>xx<>We both had a couple of drinks, including something called a "Plain stout" that was spectacular.
10126<>xx<>The bartender was very friendly and helpful, although a little on the slow side to stop by and check on us.
10127<>xx<>But his demeanor and attitude made up for it.
10128<>xx<>He seemed to be of the Irish background, along with another 'lad' behind the bar.
10129<>xx<>Definitely will be returning.
10130<>xx<>I will probably be skipping Nine Fine for this place, if things over at Nine Fine don't improve.
10131<>xx<>Really a very good find in Vegas for me.
10132<>xx<>Had a blast super cool Irish bar.
10133<>xx<>The food was really good too especially the fish and chips could easily eat two orders.
10134<>xx<>There's also a super chill room attached that's 70s themed and has a private bar which is cool for hanging out.
10135<>xx<>Great deals for locals highly recommend for a good time and cool atmosphere
10136<>xx<>We had a group of about 15-20 of us, that didn't want to pay on all one bill.
10137<>xx<>They accommodated that, with no problem.
10138<>xx<>If that doesn't earn five stars alone, then I don't get this Yelp thing at all.
10139<>xx<>For Las Vegas locals on Friday night you get a 30% discount.
10140<>xx<>Seriously.
10141<>xx<>ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.
10142<>xx<>Now the food.
10143<>xx<>They use rashers.
10144<>xx<>They use Irish Cheddar.
10145<>xx<>They use Guiness.
10146<>xx<>I always find the meat to be really good and the side dishes to be fabulous.
10147<>xx<>Best Irish pub in Vegas!!
10148<>xx<>Fish n chips are quite tasty!
10149<>xx<>Good for entertainment.
10150<>xx<>Great spot for a pint and dinner.
10151<>xx<>The staff is cool and he food was great.
10152<>xx<>Had the Killkooly sandwich-Aces!
10153<>xx<>!
10154<>xx<>Stopped by here on the way back to the room.
10155<>xx<>Was a pretty fun pub.
10156<>xx<>Servers were cool as well as the customers.
10157<>xx<>Place is pretty lively.
10158<>xx<>Have great hangover recovery food as well.
10159<>xx<>Will definitely come back.
10160<>xx<>I know Ri Ra is a chain..
10161<>xx<>But it really doesn't feel like it here.
10162<>xx<>Atmosphere: I love all the little rooms here and different types of tables.
10163<>xx<>It really does allow for the feel of an old Irish pub.
10164<>xx<>Food: I love wings- and these ones were good.
10165<>xx<>We had the honey BBQ which had just enough sweetness to be delicious.
10166<>xx<>We also had the sausage pastry rolls-- how have I never tried these before?
10167<>xx<>It's like beef Wellington but with sausage and extra phyllo dough.
10168<>xx<>Just delicious.
10169<>xx<>I'm proud of us we restrained from ordering round two of them.
10170<>xx<>Drinks: Typical beer and wine fare.. And seem to have some happy hour specials that vary by day.
10171<>xx<>This is my favorite AYCE sushi place in vegas.
10172<>xx<>The nigri sushi has a good fish-to-rice ratio.
10173<>xx<>Its the closest thing to sashimi you will find on any AYCE menu.
10174<>xx<>They have nightly specials added to their menu and I have enjoyed each one I tried- especially the yellowtail with mango!
10175<>xx<>Oh so yummy!
10176<>xx<>The service is decent but the sushi chefs can get a little backed up.
10177<>xx<>The restaurant is also rather small and they do not take reservations so you may expect to wait a while if you go fri/sat for dinner.
10178<>xx<>Came here on a Saturday evening to a packed crowd for AYCE.
10179<>xx<>($27) Wait was about 30-40min for a group of 6.
10180<>xx<>I would suggest having a volunteer go early and get your name on the list.
10181<>xx<>However, they do take reservations for groups of 10+ since they have a party room.
10182<>xx<>Food: Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy!
10183<>xx<>The Salmon nigiri melted in your mouth like butter and we ordered 654640 orders.
10184<>xx<>The fish wasn't smelly at all and you could just tell that it was super fresh.
10185<>xx<>It reminded me of the old Sushi Mon's fish (which use to be my number 1 go to place for sushi).
10186<>xx<>Tuna and Yellowtail was just as fresh and buttery.
10187<>xx<>Their new items such as the pork belly is a must try too.
10188<>xx<>We also half-ordered 10 different rolls and all of them were just as tasty.
10189<>xx<>For dessert, I got the lychee sherbert, green tea creme brulee, tofu cheesecake (tastes like cheesecake), and the fried ice cream.
10190<>xx<>All of them thumbs up!
10191<>xx<>Overall, this is now my go-to place for AYCE sushi.
10192<>xx<>They offer a variety of items and service is adeqaute.
10193<>xx<>Horrendous customer service (very slow, unprofessional, inept, and down right rude)!
10194<>xx<>Mediocre food!
10195<>xx<>Dismal portion sizes for the price!
10196<>xx<>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!
10197<>xx<>!
10198<>xx<>Sushi was average, nothing extraordinary.
10199<>xx<>As far as freshness, it was.
10200<>xx<>Selection was not as large as se of the other sushi places I've been to.
10201<>xx<>Overall, it's a decent place just nothing that was over the top.
10202<>xx<>Forgettable.
10203<>xx<>It's good but on my third visit I was not impressed.
10204<>xx<>I felt the fish to rice ratio was not too good, tiny slice of fish with too much rice.
10205<>xx<>Slow service.
10206<>xx<>I just wanted to place all my order at once but the waitress said it was too much food.
10207<>xx<>Which I assured her Ive been there before and that's how much I eat.
10208<>xx<>So had to break down the order into 3 orders and had long waits in between.
10209<>xx<>Only plus they do half roll orders so you can try more.
10210<>xx<>Best AYCE sushi place for $26.95.
10211<>xx<>Was looking around for other sushi places in Vegas but saw this place and it had pretty good recommendations.
10212<>xx<>Place was pretty packed at 5 pm Christmas Eve and the estimated wait time was an hour and a half.
10213<>xx<>However within thirty minutes we were in.
10214<>xx<>Service was prompt and quick.
10215<>xx<>We were greeted warmly and I would recommend this location to others!
10216<>xx<>Worst sushi place ever!
10217<>xx<>I came in last night with my friend and husband.
10218<>xx<>We usually come in every month but this time we will never return.
10219<>xx<>Normally, when your eating in a sushi place, the first thing everyone notice is the food, service, and waiting time.
10220<>xx<>The food was horrible.
10221<>xx<>I come to a sushi place to eat fish not rice.
10222<>xx<>I only ate the nigiri because there wasn't much good selections on rolls.
10223<>xx<>The nigiri was a disappointment.
10224<>xx<>All the fish had humongous rice and the fish was not pressed down properly.
10225<>xx<>Once you see the rice portion is bigger than the fish than that is an insult.
10226<>xx<>So we complained about it to our server.
10227<>xx<>He said he'll talk to the manager.
10228<>xx<>The server came back and said I'm sorry we CAN'T do anything about it.
10229<>xx<>The manager didn't have the balls to stop by our table and talk to us.
10230<>xx<>The manager has seen us a few times and he knows we tip 30% or more.
10231<>xx<>Back then, the manager usually greet us and takes our table.
10232<>xx<>Last time he offered comp bottle of sake but this time he acted like he barely knew us.
10233<>xx<>Anyhow, we ordered a few more to see if they would fix the problem but instead the rice gets bigger every time and the cut of fish just gets smaller.
10234<>xx<>We are not asking for them to put extremely less rice but balance out the portion of the fish to the rice.
10235<>xx<>Over all the server/manager sucks.
10236<>xx<>Poor customer service.
10237<>xx<>Waiting time was great.
10238<>xx<>There was no line, finally.
10239<>xx<>Usually, goyemon is always packed and i would wait 30 mins to an hour to be seated.
10240<>xx<>Thats how much I use to love goyemon.
10241<>xx<>It use to be worth the wait.
10242<>xx<>Food came out on time as expected.
10243<>xx<>But our server was always missing.
10244<>xx<>Server just clears out our table and runs away.
10245<>xx<>We always have to wait or ask the attentive host to call our server.
10246<>xx<>So ordering was a pain.
10247<>xx<>Overall 1 star is what they deserve.
10248<>xx<>Goyemon you just LOST 3 valuable customers.
10249<>xx<>This place only does dinner which is the only negative thing I can say about it.
10250<>xx<>Service with a smile comes to life as soon as you walk in the door.
10251<>xx<>It's always a busy place especially on weekends and they don't take reservations so plan on waiting friday and saturday.
10252<>xx<>Once seated the servers are eager to bring you your hearts desires and in a timely manner.
10253<>xx<>From the nigiri to the custom handrolls the fish is ample and fresh tasting.if your all about the AYCE, this is your place.
10254<>xx<>Have to say , visited a lot of AYCE places before but this one beats them all.
10255<>xx<>5 stars all the way for me!
10256<>xx<>Try the "lasagna" roll or if you go for dinner, the stuff from the grill(super white tuna & Cajun salmon) is delicious!
10257<>xx<>Also don't forget to get an AYCE stamp card , after 10 visits the 11th is free!
10258<>xx<>unbelievable.
10259<>xx<>this was such a great experience for me.
10260<>xx<>i have no idea why the other people complained about service.. it was top notch all the way when we were there from 4-5:30 on a friday.
10261<>xx<>the all you can eat is a bargain.
10262<>xx<>all the sushi/rolls etc you want to try but were "too cheap" to order can be had here.
10263<>xx<>out of everything that i tried i was only disappointed with one menu option.
10264<>xx<>when people say "all you can eat japanese food" i think of todai.
10265<>xx<>Todai sucks so this place is quite a delight.
10266<>xx<>although, some reviews complained about it not being 100% authentic ignore them.
10267<>xx<>doesn't matter "authentic sushi" or somewhat authentic it tastes great
10268<>xx<>I can't WAIT to get back to Phoenix again to explore this little gem a little further.
10269<>xx<>Fabulous food and cocktails abound.
10270<>xx<>LOVE the contemporary indoor-outdoor atmosphere; it almost makes you feel like you're in a REAL urban area.
10271<>xx<>Plus, the local crowd is a great mix and quite friendly.
10272<>xx<>Try sitting at the bar to do a little mingling (if you're so inclined).
10273<>xx<>We tried a couple of different cocktails, which were both simply fantastic.
10274<>xx<>Further, we tried a mixed grain salad, which was simply fantastic.
10275<>xx<>It was perfectly balanced and the orange basil vinaigrette was PERFECT.
10276<>xx<>If only all healthier cuisine tasted that damn good!
10277<>xx<>I'm sorry that we had already eaten.
10278<>xx<>Otherwise, I can't wait to sample some of their other culinary creatioions (which all looked fabulous).
10279<>xx<>I had a fantastic meal at Windsor and cannot wait to go back!!
10280<>xx<>The problem is, they do not have very many vegetarian entrée options.
10281<>xx<>I think their only entrée is what I ordered - a veggie filled pita.
10282<>xx<>It was amazingly delicious, but I wish I had more options than that....or a salad.
10283<>xx<>I appreciate that this restaurant uses lots of kale and quinoa in many of their dishes - they are two of my favorite foods and are highly underused!!
10284<>xx<>The No.
10285<>xx<>89 is one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever had and would visit this place just for cocktails.
10286<>xx<>They also have wine on tap - which is supposed to be more environmentally friendly.
10287<>xx<>The music was too loud inside and the waiter could have been more attentive - but it was their opening week so I will let that slide.
10288<>xx<>They had me at Pappy Van Winkle.
10289<>xx<>I wish money grew on trees.
10290<>xx<>Actually, I wish there was no such thing as money and Pappy flowed freely from my faucet--I just assume money growing on trees is a more likely scenario.
10291<>xx<>This restaurant has a cool atmosphere with nice outdoor seating.
10292<>xx<>Glasses of wine were okay (which is too bad since all the glasses are $9+) but the "pitchas" of beer are a pretty good deal.
10293<>xx<>The food was alright, but the service left A LOT to be desired.
10294<>xx<>Servers were slow and inattentive, and we had to consistently beg for water refills, which is a problem when you're sitting outside in 100+ degree weather.
10295<>xx<>I recommend skipping dinner at this place and just heading next door for ice cream instead!
10296<>xx<>The reviews accurately convey the general vibe and food at Windsor.
10297<>xx<>There was a small, but lively bar area and both indoor and outdoor seating for diners.
10298<>xx<>It's dark inside...that seemed a bit extreme after sunset.
10299<>xx<>The fondue is great.
10300<>xx<>I loved the pretzel bread that came with it.
10301<>xx<>The side street (Central Ave) sneaks up on you...so be on the lookout--especially if you are going there after dark!
10302<>xx<>Me and the bestie went here for brunch on a Sunday around noon.
10303<>xx<>We sat on the patio even though it was 100 plus degrees outside, the misters and shade kept us comfortable, but for those who can't handle the heat, the wait for inside was only about 15 mins.
10304<>xx<>We used the complimentary valet as parking is scarce, and hey, it was free and worth the $5 tip for the convenience.
10305<>xx<>I ordered the no.
10306<>xx<>2 drink (basically a Peach Bellini) and the simple life breakfast (2 eggs, homemade English muffin, fruit, and pork belly bacon).
10307<>xx<>Both were perfect and delicious!
10308<>xx<>The BFF ordered the Matador (Two eggs over easy stacked with griddled cheddar potatoes, a crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish) which she also said was super yummy.
10309<>xx<>We also had the No.
10310<>xx<>91 (Prosecco, House Blackberry Puree, Crème de Mure) and another fruit heaven concoction I don't recall the no.
10311<>xx<>of.
10312<>xx<>The service was stellar, quick and polite.
10313<>xx<>The drinks were sweet and tangy, cold, and refreshing.
10314<>xx<>During brunch, only $5 bucks.
10315<>xx<>Whoa!
10316<>xx<>They also have a good looking bloody mary bar which we didn't try but can't imagine could be bad!
10317<>xx<>I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen (or read).
10318<>xx<>The prices are great for brunch.
10319<>xx<>A must visit in Phoenix!
10320<>xx<>I can't say enough good about Windsor.
10321<>xx<>We went early on a Saturday evening (5:30 PM).
10322<>xx<>We were greeted within a couple of minutes of walking to the entrance, which is behind the building which faces Central Avenue.
10323<>xx<>Within a minute or two of being seated, our server came by to ask us for a drink order and someone else came by to deliver water.
10324<>xx<>As others have noted, service is excellent and team-based.
10325<>xx<>No less than 4 folks came to help us during dinner.
10326<>xx<>As if the service weren't enough, the food was really exceptional.
10327<>xx<>I'd call it elevated bar food.
10328<>xx<>We shared the "Russian Roulette" - shishito peppers sauteed in olive oil and lemon juice - and the tuna tartare.
10329<>xx<>Neither my wife nor I could decide which we liked batter, but there wasn't a crumb left on either plate when they were cleared away.
10330<>xx<>For dinner, I had the short rib, which was flavorful and fork tender.
10331<>xx<>My wife had the Ahi Tuna salad, which we agreed may have had the best prepared seared tuna we had ever had.
10332<>xx<>The food menu is complemented by a moderately small, but outstanding drink list, including wines by the glass and bottle (including some, like Bedrock Old Vine Zinfandel, which is produced in pretty small amounts!
10333<>xx<>), beers on draught and bottle (I had a Milk Stout that was awesome), excellent call liquors (I recognized some pretty good single malt scotches) and creative mixed drinks.
10334<>xx<>If I had any complaint it's that the restaurant is very loud.
10335<>xx<>Note that this doesn't diminish my view of the restaurant - it is exactly what it advertises itself to be.
10336<>xx<>We were warned that Friday and Saturday nights after 6 PM get crazy - up to an hour wait - but we'll definitely be back.
10337<>xx<>This is one restaurant that I think may actually be worth that kind of wait!
10338<>xx<>Liked the feel of the place and its hipster vibe.
10339<>xx<>Food was good and patio was really friendly
10340<>xx<>I love the pretzel dippers.
10341<>xx<>I normally order the brown bag chicken salad because it is great and not made with mayo which is great.
10342<>xx<>The kale salad is great.
10343<>xx<>My recommendation would be to try everything.
10344<>xx<>and get there before 5pm for the pitchers .
10345<>xx<>But it is a little pricey.
10346<>xx<>Came here after attempting to go to the Vig Arcadia (which was way too crowded with a 2 hour wait).
10347<>xx<>My husband's friend had recommended it.
10348<>xx<>We were both pleasantly surprised.
10349<>xx<>We had a 20 or so min wait so we grabbed a couple beers at the bar.
10350<>xx<>Score!
10351<>xx<>$7.50 for 2 pints of Stella.
10352<>xx<>I don't think we've had a beer that cheap since our college days.
10353<>xx<>The bartenders were really nice as was the hostess.
10354<>xx<>We were seated outside which is a very nice patio with misters.
10355<>xx<>They had a great playlist of background music which added to the candlelit ambience.
10356<>xx<>I wasn't too hungry so ordered the ceviche for my entree and my husband had the windsor burger with roasted veggies.
10357<>xx<>Omg.
10358<>xx<>Those roasted veggies were da bomd!
10359<>xx<>I was upset because I usually pick fries off of his plate....but these veggies were exceptionally tasty.
10360<>xx<>The ceviche was okay.
10361<>xx<>His burger was cooked perfectly and prob one of the best burgers in phoenix so far (more so than vinburger, smashburger).
10362<>xx<>Being this place is fairly close to home with a great ambience, fair priced drinks and good food, we will definitley be back!
10363<>xx<>Hit I LUV AREPAS for a quick lunch snack - I think it's actually smaller than a food truck !
10364<>xx<>I originally thought it replaced the Naked City Sammie space but not true - a stand alone shack on Dino's  parking lot ( maybe it uses the NC space for prep work ... not sure )   Had the pollo arepas ( $3 ) and the carne ( $3.50 )   Comes with a side of spicy and mild sauce - damned if I know what's in them  the spicy had a smokiness to it, the Mild a cream base - both very good.
10365<>xx<>The arepas ??
10366<>xx<>I actually like the pollo more but both were very good.
10367<>xx<>They basically take a corn based thick pancake,  cut in 1/2 and stuff with meat - no frills - simple food with great flavor .
10368<>xx<>I wanted a bacon dog ($2.25 ) but not ready yet - next time because there will be many next times  crappy pics added
10369<>xx<>VIva Las Arepas is super tasty!
10370<>xx<>I was in heaven when I first tried their signature arepa.
10371<>xx<>It's a little greasy, but that's to be expected.
10372<>xx<>if you haven't tried the Venezualan soda, Frescolita, I highly recommend it - tastes like bubblegum.
10373<>xx<>And it's the only place in Vegas you can find it.
10374<>xx<>Buen provecho!
10375<>xx<>Viva Las Arepas has it all.
10376<>xx<>I prefer restaurants with fresh ingredients, new and creative flavors, served by an attentive staff in a convenient location.
10377<>xx<>This is Viva Las Arepas all the way!
10378<>xx<>I don't know how they do it, but everything I've ever had here is amazing.
10379<>xx<>The only problem is that I struggle to order anything new since what I've had before is already so hard to choose from.
10380<>xx<>The fries and black beans are really great, and they offer generous portions of each for only $3, great for sharing.
10381<>xx<>The Arepas of course are the specialty, but I don't think I've seen an entree there that didn't look great.
10382<>xx<>Unfortunately, the location is a little bit sketchy for some, but I look at it as their loss.
10383<>xx<>Yes, it's not the nicest area of Las Vegas, but it is right near downtown and a convenient stop before heading to any of the uber-trendy bars in the area.
10384<>xx<>Priced for lunch, Viva Las Arepas might be the best value for food in all of Las Vegas.
10385<>xx<>I don't know anywhere else that offers so much fresh, amazing food for under $10.
10386<>xx<>I don't know why yelp isn't updated but this place moved from a stand to a shop and the prices went way way up.
10387<>xx<>Everything is from $6 and up including tax!
10388<>xx<>That's double the prices the pictures are saying so you've been warned!
10389<>xx<>When you double your prices you got to do something different.
10390<>xx<>Bigger sandwiches, something.
10391<>xx<>These arepas are very good and a nice change from the usual Mexican food in LA, but it's not a good value.
10392<>xx<>I would be perfectly happy paying $3, not the $6 I paid.
10393<>xx<>The bread was clearly made fresh and it was good.
10394<>xx<>The beef was very well seasoned.
10395<>xx<>Unfortunately I wasn't satisfied.
10396<>xx<>I would have been fine buying two for $6 but not 2 for $12.
10397<>xx<>To be full you need 2 which makes the cost of these ridiculous!
10398<>xx<>No wonder why this very highly rated place had nobody in it.
10399<>xx<>It seems as if they've passed on their added costs to the customers but that price hike scared everyone away.
10400<>xx<>Amazing food or not I will not be back!
10401<>xx<>!
10402<>xx<>This food was disgusting!
10403<>xx<>I would rather have eaten at MCDONALDS!
10404<>xx<>Bad combination of ingredients!
10405<>xx<>I have no idea why this place has 4.5 stars!
10406<>xx<>I knew the next time I went to visit Art of Flavors I would be eating dinner here first.
10407<>xx<>So tonight was the night!!
10408<>xx<>A date night with myself!
10409<>xx<>I wasn't really sure what Arepas were but I'm up for an adventure.
10410<>xx<>I briefly read up a bit on what to expect and went with the flow when I got there.
10411<>xx<>Trying to recover from the Smashburger hangover from the night before and still thinking about that Black Bean Burger, I got the Vegetarian Arepa and a side of Rice with Veggies.
10412<>xx<>So I found out that an Arepa is like a cornmeal English muffin crossed with taco like fillings.
10413<>xx<>In my Vegetarian Arepa was Black Beans, Onions, Tomato and Avocado.
10414<>xx<>So good!
10415<>xx<>At $5 it was a pretty good "sandwich".
10416<>xx<>Leave it in the wrapper it comes in it will help save you from losing all the insides.
10417<>xx<>The Rice and Veggies were good and a decent size portion but for $2.99 for white rice and canned mixed veggies, I filled up enough with just my Arepa.
10418<>xx<>This was a counter service restaurant.
10419<>xx<>You order at the counter, you pick up your food at the counter and your put your own trash in the trash can that is clear and obvious to put your trays and baskets on top.
10420<>xx<>I'll be back!!
10421<>xx<>It was delish!
10422<>xx<>!
10423<>xx<>We were meeting some friends at the Stratosphere and decided to stop by here since it was literally across the street.
10424<>xx<>The parking lot was tiny and somewhere you don't want to be walking around alone in at night, but the small sit down restaurant was simple and clean.
10425<>xx<>We ordered the grilled chicken arepas and black bean and cheese empanadas.
10426<>xx<>The food took almost 20 minutes to come out and it wasn't that busy around 5:30 pm on a Friday evening.
10427<>xx<>The arepas look kind of small, but they were much bigger and stuffed so we really didn't need the empanadas!
10428<>xx<>The cornmeal breading was so yummy and the grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato and cheese was really good.
10429<>xx<>They served their hot sauce and another sauce with cilantro/mayo on the side which were good complements but not necessary with the arepas.
10430<>xx<>The empanadas were greasy and only half filled on the inside, but tasty.
10431<>xx<>Didn't have any room for the guava/cheese pastelito, but would love to try it next time!
10432<>xx<>Blame it on the A-a-a-a-a-alcohol if you want, but the food this place puts out was like mana from heaven at midnight last Saturday night.
10433<>xx<>We were leaving Dino's and a friend suggested we get Arepas, since I'd never tried them before.
10434<>xx<>We got a beef arepa and a lingua arepa.
10435<>xx<>When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down.
10436<>xx<>I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking.
10437<>xx<>The shredded beef was so tender and hearty.
10438<>xx<>The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions.
10439<>xx<>It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so.
10440<>xx<>It was delicious!
10441<>xx<>It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked!
10442<>xx<>I'm actually considering driving there on my lunch hour today (completely sober of course)!
10443<>xx<>This place is a must try if you've never had an Arepa, or if you're close to downtown and hungry!
10444<>xx<>Do NOT miss this chance to get Arepas, if you are visiting Las Vegas.
10445<>xx<>Do not fail to support a local business, if you are a resident!
10446<>xx<>On our first visit, I had the reina pepiada (chicken/avocado) arepa and my husband had the pabellon (shredded beef) arepa.
10447<>xx<>Both were so delicious!!
10448<>xx<>The masa wrap was crisp but tender, and the fillings very flavorful.
10449<>xx<>We've since tried most of the fillings, and every arepa has been fresh and tasty.
10450<>xx<>This is a far distance from Mexican food; but f you like a little heat, there are Venezuelan hot sauces on the tables.
10451<>xx<>We've also had the pastelitos, and while we didn't think they quite as good as the arepas, the fillings were very flavorful.
10452<>xx<>The Venezuelan sodas are exotic enough to be worth a try too; but my personal favorite drink is the "Agua Panela", sugar cane with lime.
10453<>xx<>I love any drink that involves raw sugar cane, and in this one the lime cuts the sweetness just right but not so much that it tastes like limeade.
10454<>xx<>I have two standout memories from my first visit.
10455<>xx<>First, I wanted to try the yuca fries, but my husband was being a little conservative about them.
10456<>xx<>So we didn't order...but the owner brought over an order for us to try anyway, on the house!
10457<>xx<>They were so good and crispy, and I've ordered them ever since.
10458<>xx<>My second memory is of the wood stacked in full view of the dining area, so you know they are always smoking that meat right in-house.
10459<>xx<>I also have to complement the owners on a bright, folksy, and clean atmosphere.
10460<>xx<>It was a pleasure to sit there...reminded me a lot of small cafes we encountered in our trips to central America...but with air-conditioning, LOL!
10461<>xx<>Very affordable eating for "The Strip"...please get out of those casinos and try this and other local businesses in our fabulous city.
10462<>xx<>By the way, the very best gelato place in town, "Art of Flavors" is right next door (that's not just my opinion, but I totally concur); so save some room for dessert.
10463<>xx<>This is gluten free heaven!
10464<>xx<>My friend introduced me to this place and I am always hesitant to try new foods when I am unfamiliar with the ingredients and when there is a possibility there could be a translation problem that I need to be wheat free!
10465<>xx<>I checked out the menu online and saw I could order a plate, then I noticed gluten free on the website and I cheered, I can eat a sandwich!
10466<>xx<>I ordered the wood fired beef, plantains and the lime with cane sugar drink and it was absolutely delicious!
10467<>xx<>They give you sauces to add to the sandwiches that was fabulous, the plantains were yummy as well as the drink it went perfect together.
10468<>xx<>I look forward to trying the other meats they offer.
10469<>xx<>There is a patio outside however there are no misters so it could be a little warm during the day but for a summer night it will work!
10470<>xx<>That area of the Strip is a little dicey but it is part of the charm!
10471<>xx<>Love this place, it's very cute and small but has the option for outdoor seating.
10472<>xx<>Today was windy so we decided to eat indoors, the turnover is pretty quick since all they're serving is pretty much crepes which don't take too long to prepare.
10473<>xx<>We ordered a strawberry and mango mimosa, veggie patch crepe and the nutty classic crepe.
10474<>xx<>While waiting you can watch on the tv screen your crepe being prepared in real time.
10475<>xx<>I was thinking my Nutella crepe would be super sweet so I helped myself to the cucumber water (they also had lemon water) while we were waiting.
10476<>xx<>The crepe actually wasn't that sweet at all, overall I enjoyed the food, the infused water and the quaint dining room, our cashier was also really nice and knowledgeable which made our entire experience here great.
10477<>xx<>We will return and try more crepes!
10478<>xx<>They have about 13 varieties of mimosas and they serve beer!
10479<>xx<>Amazing crepes!!!
10480<>xx<>I was not a huge crepe fan until I have eaten here.
10481<>xx<>The crepes here are so soft and fluffy and the fillings are just impeccably put together.
10482<>xx<>I love the Ruben crepe.
10483<>xx<>Taste even better than some of the Ruben in New York.
10484<>xx<>Thank you for making such delectable food!
10485<>xx<>The service was awesome and the food was very delicious!!
10486<>xx<>Highly recommended!!
10487<>xx<>The only reason i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because my silverware was dirty and had chocolate on it other than that everything else was really great.
10488<>xx<>Why this place would have anything less than five stars is beyond me.
10489<>xx<>The food was outstanding, proportions are generous, you get warm and personalized service plus a charming decor to boot!
10490<>xx<>Want to substitute an ingredient?
10491<>xx<>You got it.
10492<>xx<>More meat?
10493<>xx<>You betcha!
10494<>xx<>I'll try any gluten free place at least once, but here I didn't feel deprived whatsoever on account of my diet.
10495<>xx<>My only regret is that I can't take this gem of a creperie back home with me.
10496<>xx<>Place was fantastic!
10497<>xx<>Went there after landing in Las Vegas and did a Yelp search by highest rated and this one came up.
10498<>xx<>I had the eggs and mushrooms crepe and the fresh strawberries with chocolate drizzled on the top with fresh whip cream and a fresh squeezed OJ.
10499<>xx<>Highly recommend this place to anyone that is close-by.
10500<>xx<>Amazing food.
10501<>xx<>Best creeps I've ever had.
10502<>xx<>Definitely worth the visit.
10503<>xx<>The fresh squeezed juices are great as well.
10504<>xx<>I'm in love with this place!
10505<>xx<>My mom and I ended up going here on a Sunday morning.
10506<>xx<>We each had the Rosarito Breakfast Crepe with coffee.
10507<>xx<>Loved every bite of it!
10508<>xx<>I told my friend Chastine V. how awesome it was so we met for brunch....I had the Pirate with the mimosa trio (orange, white peach and passion fruit).
10509<>xx<>Once again, loved every bite and sip of this meal!
10510<>xx<>Finally, my husband agreed to go because I wouldn't stop raving about it!
10511<>xx<>He had the Sonora...awesome!
10512<>xx<>And I tried the Greek...very delicious.
10513<>xx<>Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of this place and have every intention of coming back...soon!
10514<>xx<>And I'm going to bring my dogs!
10515<>xx<>My wife and I really enjoyed our breakfast here.
10516<>xx<>Highly recommend to anyone.
10517<>xx<>One of the unique things about Crepe Expectations is that you can see your crepe being made.
10518<>xx<>Their crepe griddles are behind a glass panel offering a perfect view.
10519<>xx<>And they have a camera mounted above the griddles so you can also see them being made on the TV.
10520<>xx<>Way cool.
10521<>xx<>My family and I ordered 4 different crepes.
10522<>xx<>It took a little while for us to receive them, but it's understandable seeing how crowded it was.
10523<>xx<>Each one was delicious.
10524<>xx<>Especially the Capresse crepe.
10525<>xx<>The employees are so nice and welcoming.
10526<>xx<>They really make sure everything is taken care of.
10527<>xx<>A nice touch: you can choose between cucumber water and lemon water.
10528<>xx<>They had 12 different mimosas.
10529<>xx<>I wish I ordered one.
10530<>xx<>Such a lovely little place!
10531<>xx<>It is not your typical crepe shop that's decored with white walls and contemporary furniture.
10532<>xx<>This crepe shop has a whole lot of personality that screams black and purple.
10533<>xx<>Its very intimate and romantic (great for sunday brunch dates or coffee shop dates.
10534<>xx<>Wink wink fellas!)
10535<>xx<>It is a petite shop, and you better believe the seats never stay empty!
10536<>xx<>There is also an outdoor seating area which is a nice spot to have Saturday breakfast when all the cool vintage cars are parked outside.
10537<>xx<>It makes a great start for conversation!
10538<>xx<>I came with my mom who absolutely adores this place (if my mom is willing to a take a trip down to this area then you know its for a good reason!)
10539<>xx<>She ordered the Berry Delight crepe ($7.50) and you get the berry works!
10540<>xx<>It includes blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries with whipped cream on top.
10541<>xx<>Its berry delightful!
10542<>xx<>(Insert drum roll here) If you don't want a sweet and heavy crepe this would be a great option.
10543<>xx<>Its filled with fruit, which won't be filling to your tummy.
10544<>xx<>I picked the Monkey ($6.50).
10545<>xx<>It's a typical choice for me since my favorite crepe includes nutella, bananas, and strawberries.
10546<>xx<>The Monkey has bananas, nutella, and whipped cream.
10547<>xx<>I also added strawberries as an additional ingredient.
10548<>xx<>I intent to come back again, and step outside of the box to try the rest of the menu items.
10549<>xx<>They also have great Savory Menu with crepe items that have pepperoni, spinach, mozarella, tomato ingredients, and more!
10550<>xx<>Lastly, a great pair with our crepes was the Mimosa Trio Sampler ($10.00) which provides your choice of three various mimosas to taste that you can pick from the menu.
10551<>xx<>Its a perfect sample size especially if you're in it for taste and less on getting crunk in the AM or afternoon.
10552<>xx<>(Fellas this would be a fun option if you bring a date with you!
10553<>xx<>Hint.
10554<>xx<>Hint) We chose the blood orange, guava, and cherry mimosa to sample.
10555<>xx<>My favorite was the blood orange!
10556<>xx<>Filled with a variety flavors on the menu and they are all such original selections.
10557<>xx<>I never knew that there was a variety of ways to make mimosas besides OJ until now!
10558<>xx<>How fun!
10559<>xx<>You can watch them make your crepe on the tv as well.
10560<>xx<>So you know exactly when your order is coming!
10561<>xx<>It's a great family owned business and they are all so helpful with assisting you in making a decision.
10562<>xx<>They really know how to be welcoming and feel like you're right at home.
10563<>xx<>I can't wait to go back!
10564<>xx<>This place is amazing!
10565<>xx<>The pastor was so good it made us come back wanting more for breakfast.
10566<>xx<>If your in Vegas you have to stop.
10567<>xx<>Ps: all of the reviews about this place being sort of a cluster are correct it is but over whelming but do worth it.
10568<>xx<>People go nuts for this place, me?
10569<>xx<>Eeehhh....
10570<>xx<>The tacos are pretty good but not amazing.
10571<>xx<>The wait to order is usually insane.
10572<>xx<>Last time I was there, there were 4 separate lines and the lines stretched outside (should be an indication of amazingness but no), needles to say we waited for like 40 min to order.
10573<>xx<>I don't think they're 40 min wait good...
10574<>xx<>The lines are usually crazy and chaotic so be prepared.
10575<>xx<>They do have a nice variety of meats for a fast food type of joint.
10576<>xx<>They have options like chicken, steak, beef shoulder, tongue, brain and spicy pork.
10577<>xx<>The spicy pork is the best!
10578<>xx<>Those are 4*.
10579<>xx<>This is where you want to eat!
10580<>xx<>Delicious tacos, served hot with fresh ingredients.
10581<>xx<>As an added bonus, it's super cheap!
10582<>xx<>Legit, no frills, delicious tacos.
10583<>xx<>All for $2 each.
10584<>xx<>Need I say more?
10585<>xx<>$2 spicy pork tacos.
10586<>xx<>You want these.
10587<>xx<>Tasty snack and best deal on the strip.
10588<>xx<>Yummy Mexican sodas to boot, what's not to love.
10589<>xx<>A friend suggested Tacos El Gordo when I mentioned Las Vegas so I came on yelp to check out the reviews.
10590<>xx<>I read that the wait was crazy long.
10591<>xx<>We were here the first week of May and not sure if this is a slow month for Vegas in general but we walked right into Tacos El Gordo and there wasn't a line- both times we went.
10592<>xx<>It was great!
10593<>xx<>I was expecting at least a 20 min wait.
10594<>xx<>I love lengua in general so of course that's what I ordered and it was delicious.
10595<>xx<>My husband ordered carne Asada and he loved it.
10596<>xx<>We came back again for lunch the next day.
10597<>xx<>I would eat here everyday if I could.
10598<>xx<>Don't forget the horchata drink for just $1.50!
10599<>xx<>great spot for tacos.
10600<>xx<>gets very crowded.
10601<>xx<>its hot as hell inside.
10602<>xx<>tacos are ok. not true tasting like the tacos from TJ but the average person will love them.
10603<>xx<>mulas are awesome (sincronisadas, quesadillas with your choice of meat).
10604<>xx<>my fav taco joint in vegas so far!
10605<>xx<>This isn't my first time here at Tacos El Gordo and it definitely isn't my last.
10606<>xx<>This one in particular, is at the end of the strip, near circus circus and encore.
10607<>xx<>I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place.
10608<>xx<>The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos.
10609<>xx<>The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it.
10610<>xx<>The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!
10611<>xx<>I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people.
10612<>xx<>It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green "crack" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.
10613<>xx<>The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10.
10614<>xx<>For vegas, this is great, cheap food.
10615<>xx<>I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends.
10616<>xx<>Early in the morning or late at night - it's always a good time for Tacos El Gordo!
10617<>xx<>I eat a lot of tacos, probably too many tacos, and this place is my gold standard for taco measuring.
10618<>xx<>Great authentic tacos, plus they have free guac (take note, Chipotle) and delicious quesadillas.
10619<>xx<>People literally sit outside of this place waiting for it to open in the morning - it's that good.
10620<>xx<>But don't be fooled, they may open the door but you still have to wait another 40 min or so to get that taco goodness in you because they still have to finish cooking it all so all you can really get when they first open the doors is a drink.
10621<>xx<>It's a tease.
10622<>xx<>Plan accordingly.
10623<>xx<>I like this place.
10624<>xx<>The people working here were all so friendly and very inviting.
10625<>xx<>The food was well priced for Vegas.
10626<>xx<>and the carne asade was REAL carne asada juicy and delicious!
10627<>xx<>The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 was because I ordered the carne asada fries and they were a little dry.
10628<>xx<>But someone else might hive the tacos a 5!
10629<>xx<>Worth a try.
10630<>xx<>:)
10631<>xx<>Worth the $$$ and experience, loved the old Las Vegas feel to the max !!!!!
10632<>xx<>Had a Frank Sinatra impersonator, service was superb, and food was to die for.
10633<>xx<>The concierge at our hotel had not heard of this restaurant, so it's def a hidden gem!
10634<>xx<>*3.5 Stars*  We decided to try the Barrymore after reading the positive reviews on Yelp.
10635<>xx<>The Royal Resort is actual a cute little place on the inside.
10636<>xx<>The Barrymore was decorated nicely.
10637<>xx<>We had a drink at the bar before dinner and then we were seated by the window.
10638<>xx<>Um...let's just say, I would have rather not been seated by the window.
10639<>xx<>The Barrymore is in a less than desirable location behind the strip.
10640<>xx<>I had a view of a giant Ross, and the back of the Circus Circus.
10641<>xx<>No thanks.
10642<>xx<>I believe the ambiance of our dinner would have been much nicer had we been seated somewhere else.
10643<>xx<>It ruined it a little for me.
10644<>xx<>Now on to the food.
10645<>xx<>They brought out some bread and butter to start off with.
10646<>xx<>Parmesan crisps, French bread and some pretzel bread with bacon and cranberries that was delicious.
10647<>xx<>The flavor combo in that bread was insane.
10648<>xx<>We ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were very good, they had a nice sauce and some grilled bread to sop it up with.
10649<>xx<>For our entrees, I order the strip steak with a baked potato and my husband ordered the seared ahi.
10650<>xx<>First off, let me say, I ordered my steak medium and it was almost rare.
10651<>xx<>I don't have a problem with rare, I just prefer medium.
10652<>xx<>It was seasoned very well and tender but I would have preferred it to be cooked longer.
10653<>xx<>After a few bites, rare is a little difficult for me to eat.
10654<>xx<>The baked potato was uneventful and I wish I would have saved my $6 dollars and the calories.
10655<>xx<>My husband's ahi was delicious.
10656<>xx<>I would recommend that dish.
10657<>xx<>We ended with the ricotta cheesecake and the sorbet.
10658<>xx<>I was a little disappointed in the cheesecake, it was good but it was tiny.
10659<>xx<>We each had one bite each, it wasn't even half a piece.
10660<>xx<>The sorbet was good, it tasted a little like Thrifty's to me.
10661<>xx<>All in all it was a solid meal.
10662<>xx<>The service was a little weird, we had ordered a meal to go and they forgot, and they switched servers mid-meal.
10663<>xx<>But our server was very nice and gave a good recommendation for a wine to go with my steak that was tasty and well-priced.
10664<>xx<>Don't get me wrong, The Barrymore was very good and we may try it again.
10665<>xx<>It was just lacking the wow factor that I look for when I go out for a nice meal.
10666<>xx<>I went here this past Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday, and I'm glad I did!
10667<>xx<>The Barrymore is a beautiful little restaurant hidden inside a very sketchy Hotel right off the Vegas Strip.
10668<>xx<>As I walked up to the front door I was a little nervous because I saw the typical douchey Vegas tourists in their flip flops, Tommy Bahama shirts, and golfing shorts..This is a FANCY restaurant..Try to have some class, this isn't Fremont or The Circus Circus Buffet.
10669<>xx<>We made it in time for our 7:30 reservation, but had to wait,  we sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks and looked around in awe..  Beautiful art works, old Hollywood Glamour furnishings..I felt like I had gone back in time..A time before Ed Hardy, Tommy Bahama, and Tapout... After we waited for a while I finally went back to the hostess stand, and found out that she gave our table away.
10670<>xx<>The VERY TALL manager overheard and promptly bought us a round of drinks for our patience.
10671<>xx<>He made sure that we were happy and well taken care of, especially hearing that we were locals.
10672<>xx<>I just moved here from L.A. where a manager wouldn't give to shits about giving away your table, so this all came as a shock to me.
10673<>xx<>We finally sit at our table, I can't stop thinking about how utterly gorgeous everything was..    O.K.
10674<>xx<>FOOD!..
10675<>xx<>We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese ( who wouldn't?! )
10676<>xx<>It was creamy,rich, and mouthwatering..
10677<>xx<>I also ordered the kale salad which was also good..but I actually love the Winter Kale Salad @Culinary Dropout 1000 times better..My friends all loved their main courses..but I ordered the Chicken, which seemed like an after thought..it wasn't good..
10678<>xx<>It was VERY dry and flavourless.
10679<>xx<>I am looking forward to revisiting The Barrymore, but I will  definitely be getting a different entree or maybe just order two bowls of the Lobster Mac and Cheese.
10680<>xx<>:)  So visit The Barrymore, but please don't dress like a tacky tourist!
10681<>xx<>Loved, loved, loved The Barrymore.
10682<>xx<>The ambviance is just delightful and quirky with an old vegas meets old hollywood vibe with the velvet semi-circle booths and inkplot portraits....
10683<>xx<>It's comfortable and classy at the same time.
10684<>xx<>The waitstaff has you in the palm of their hand from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave - describing dishes, providing extensive knowledge about the food and its preparation, liberally giving you their recommendations if you are waffling (which I do), getting you set up with the correct before-dinner drinks, etc.
10685<>xx<>They are incredibly friendly and not stuffy at all and you really feel like you are just getting the most amazing service from someone who is thrilled to be there and there with you.
10686<>xx<>The sommalier (who I believe is also the manager?
10687<>xx<>I could be wrong?)
10688<>xx<>is THE BEST!
10689<>xx<>We told him what we wanted in a wine and what our tastes were leaning towards as of late as well as our price-point, and he outlined several choices, describing each wine in sommalier terms that were technical as well as knowledgeable...  From that, he gave us his final recommendation, which we went with, and of course it was PERFECT...The thing about The Barrymore is that the food backs it all up!
10690<>xx<>Great service and just amazing food.
10691<>xx<>We had the lobster macaroni and cheese for an appetizer (sweet lord good) and swooned over the bread selection, especially the one with the bacon and fruit (cranberries?
10692<>xx<>maybe cherries?)
10693<>xx<>baked in....  We then went onto   My husband had the ribeye and I had the quail and we shared a side of the risotto special that day on the waiter's recommendation, and he was dead on.
10694<>xx<>It was all just out of this world.
10695<>xx<>Two regrets - we ate at Sage in the Aria the next night and it was a big fat expensive disappointment after The Barrymore... also we were too full to try desert....  something I will regret for  a long time:)
10696<>xx<>We had a very early dinner last Friday.
10697<>xx<>There were just a handful of people in the lounge.
10698<>xx<>Immediately we were greeted by our fabulous server, Gabriel.
10699<>xx<>His selection of Pinot Noir was right on the mark!
10700<>xx<>We ordered the Sicilian octopus appetizer which my daughter and I shared (the BF opted to pass.)
10701<>xx<>The bread basket was awesome.
10702<>xx<>Fresh baguettes, parmesan cheese crisps and a hearty bread that was sweet (dried fruit) and savory (our favorite.)
10703<>xx<>The octopus was a little on the chewy side, but was still delicious topped with the onion relish.
10704<>xx<>My daughter had squash curry.
10705<>xx<>True to Gabriel's word, the curry was light and delicious.
10706<>xx<>I will be on the search for vadouvan spice in Vegas soon.
10707<>xx<>The BF had the NY Strip.
10708<>xx<>While no sauce was needed, the Béarnaise was the hands down winner.
10709<>xx<>I had the Alaskan halibut.
10710<>xx<>The fish was moist and very flavorful.
10711<>xx<>As a rule, I do not like okra (too slimy), but give me those crispy fried critters any day.
10712<>xx<>Just wish there were a few more.
10713<>xx<>We were all much too full for dessert, so we decided just to "look" at the dessert menu.
10714<>xx<>Gabriel said that his favorite dessert was the Raspberry Frangipane tart, which we shared (fought over).
10715<>xx<>The tartness of the sherbet and the sweetness of the almond raspberry tart were perfect.
10716<>xx<>We kept hitting spoons!
10717<>xx<>It was a great night, made special by the great company and interaction with Gabriel.
10718<>xx<>Did I say that I love Gabriel?
10719<>xx<>This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas... Great atmosphere...great food (grilled octopus and rib eye for two are two of my faves!)
10720<>xx<>- great wine list!
10721<>xx<>You must come here for dinner!
10722<>xx<>!
10723<>xx<>"Here's Looking at You Kid"  The Barrymore is a wonderful restaurant and bar located inside the Royal Resort Hotel walking distance from the Vegas strip.
10724<>xx<>Sitting in this restaurant makes you feel like you experiencing what Vegas must have been like during the rat pack era.
10725<>xx<>I was very impressed with the food, drinks, and ambience of the Barrymore.
10726<>xx<>i loved the decor, the service, and the cozy feeling of this place.
10727<>xx<>Although the Barrymore is located inside the Royal Resort Hotel, it is as good as any of the best restaurants located in the more contemporary hotels.
10728<>xx<>We visited on a cold winter afternoon for happy hour.
10729<>xx<>Lobster Deviled Eggs and a Barrymore Burger hit the spot.
10730<>xx<>They offer a full bar with signmature cockatails.
10731<>xx<>I had the Barrymore cockktail which offers an interesting distinctive taste all while giving you an alchohol fix, the wife had their margarita which was delish.
10732<>xx<>The Barrymore offered other cocktails that I would love to try for my next visit.
10733<>xx<>The Barrymore definitely gets my stamp of approval: Q!
10734<>xx<>This place is amazing!
10735<>xx<>Large film reels adorned the ceiling above and the mirrors all around us really opened up the place and gave it a sort of glimmer.
10736<>xx<>I didn't feel like I was in Vegas, I felt like I was in a 1930's film.
10737<>xx<>Our waiter from the beginning was very accommodating and he had a REAL sense of humor, not fake at all.
10738<>xx<>Started off with some cucumber mojitos that were light and refreshing...cool as the cucumber muddled in it.
10739<>xx<>I ordered the Dungeness Crab appetizer thinking I was going to have to do some work, however all of the meat was placed neatly on top of a delicious gazpacho type sauce that I thoroughly enjoyed.
10740<>xx<>I even took my spoon and ate the remaining sauce like it was a soup.
10741<>xx<>For my main I ordered the Vadouvan Squash Curry w/ couscous.
10742<>xx<>I was impressed with the curry flavor, it wasn't too heavy, but it wasn't light either.
10743<>xx<>I wondered if there was a bit of coconut milk in it.
10744<>xx<>Regardless, I ate it ALL!
10745<>xx<>It was time for dessert and I was so full, but I HAD to order something so I went with the Pistachio ice cream- by the way all of their ice cream is house made.
10746<>xx<>If you like pistachios, you will like this.
10747<>xx<>The Barrymore is off the beaten path, which appealed to me because I really didn't feel like eating at a crowded pretentious restaurant.
10748<>xx<>Be prepared to spend a lot of money, it is kind of pricey, but it's worth it.
10749<>xx<>Ah-mazing.
10750<>xx<>Read the reviews and it was right down the street from where we were staying.
10751<>xx<>5 stars all around.
10752<>xx<>Can't recommend enough.
10753<>xx<>I'll be bring more clients here in the future.
10754<>xx<>The fact that the Barrymore is in the Royal Palace gives it an instantly seedy feel.
10755<>xx<>It doesn't help that you have to walk through the hotel lobby to use the restrooms either.
10756<>xx<>I guess the location is (kinda) beside the point.
10757<>xx<>Went for dinner last night and we shared an iceberg wedge salad (they split it for us, which was nice), lobster mac and cheese, and the famous burger.
10758<>xx<>The salad was skippable.
10759<>xx<>The lobster mac and cheese was good but I think I was expecting something more monumental given all the other solid yelp reviews.
10760<>xx<>The burger was definitely the standout of the meal so thanks to yelpers for letting us know that we could secretly order it even though it was not on the menu.
10761<>xx<>We had a few beers to go along with the meal & the total bill just under $100, not bad at all.
10762<>xx<>They served us mini macaroons with our bill which was a nice touch too :)  All in all, a pretty good place but probably not one that I will make a concerted effort to seek out again when I am in town.
10763<>xx<>Ordered spicy chicken fried rice, chicken wings and spring rolls, everything was tasty.
10764<>xx<>Spring rolls were so good we had a second order!
10765<>xx<>The spicy fried rice, we ordered the spiciest and believe it or not but it was actually spicy.
10766<>xx<>Usually whenever I order the spiciest, I still have to add more, not in this case.
10767<>xx<>Also tried the thaijito, I'm not a big drinker but this cocktail was delicious.
10768<>xx<>We went at dinner time on a weekend and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated.
10769<>xx<>Service was good.
10770<>xx<>Whenever in Vegas, I will make a b-line straight to this joint!
10771<>xx<>Obsessed w this place.
10772<>xx<>Best thai food in Vegas.
10773<>xx<>Love their pad thai!!
10774<>xx<>Service is quick, super friendly.
10775<>xx<>I just wish they delivered!
10776<>xx<>Still getting 5 stars tho!
10777<>xx<>It's worth the travel to downtown to go to this place!
10778<>xx<>Yum!
10779<>xx<>Le Thai is a gem located downtown on Fremont St.
10780<>xx<>Although I am a bit of a Strip-snob, when venturing downtown, Le Thai is a solid choice for thai food.
10781<>xx<>Most recently I enjoyed the Thai beef salad.
10782<>xx<>Although the meat wasn't as thin and tender as what is found in the Thai beef salad at Pin Kaow, the flavors and textures were still delicious.
10783<>xx<>I had a spice level 4 (scale 1-5) and it was a nice amount of heat.
10784<>xx<>I didn't mind sitting outside, although it is still a bit chilly now.
10785<>xx<>The space heaters they have strung on top of the patio provide ample warmth.
10786<>xx<>Service was friendly and quick.
10787<>xx<>Will be back soon :)
10788<>xx<>Great service, great spices, great destination away from the mainstream Fremont tourism, just a short walk across the street.
10789<>xx<>The best Thai food I've ever had.
10790<>xx<>No joke.
10791<>xx<>EVER.
10792<>xx<>When I heard there was a 60 minute wait on a Monday night in Downtown, I thought "you gotta be kidding me?"
10793<>xx<>But a large format bottle of sake quickly mollified me.
10794<>xx<>Besides, you can get anything off the menu from the to-go window outside,  so 15 minutes later I was eating a couple appetizers.
10795<>xx<>There weren't many vegetarian options, so I ordered spring rolls with GREAT trepidation, because, are spring rolls EVER good?
10796<>xx<>No!
10797<>xx<>They are NEVER, EVER good.
10798<>xx<>They're only occasionally not terrible.
10799<>xx<>They're like the Thai equivalent of mozzarella sticks.
10800<>xx<>Except at this place.
10801<>xx<>These weren't just not terrible, they were TERRIFIC.
10802<>xx<>As in, has every other spring roll I've ever had prior just been deep fried crab grass?
10803<>xx<>Because THESE were golden, crispy PERFECTION.
10804<>xx<>They were like MDMA dipped in cocaine served on a silver salver of multiple orgasms.
10805<>xx<>For my main course I had a level 3 yellow curry.
10806<>xx<>Pretty much my go to order at an unfamiliar Thai restaurant.
10807<>xx<>Except, now, having eaten their yellow curry, I don't think I will EVER be able to go-to another yellow curry again.
10808<>xx<>This yellow curry was so fucking amazing that my taste buds will probably go all Norma Rae on my mouth if ever attempt to feed them anything but this sweet, spicy, NECTAR OF THE GODS.
10809<>xx<>The service was likely very good and the decor was probably too, but I really can't say for sure because I spent the next hour basically awash in serotonin and dopamine.
10810<>xx<>They should be handing out cards to this place on the Strip along with those glosssy pictures of strippers and escorts.
10811<>xx<>Wonderful food and location!
10812<>xx<>I loved that this place was away from tourists, but still easy to access, just a block down from Fremont Street.
10813<>xx<>We actually had lunch here twice during our stay in Vegas.
10814<>xx<>The place is small and usually there was a line forming as we were leaving, so it's probably best to arrive early.
10815<>xx<>We both got the Awesome Noodle with tofu on our first visit and it was exactly as the name states: awesome!
10816<>xx<>On our second visit, I tried the Panang Curry.
10817<>xx<>It was very good and a pretty large portion size.
10818<>xx<>I recommend the Spiced Thai Iced Tea as well!
10819<>xx<>I've got Le Thai at a 3.5 out of 5 Stars.
10820<>xx<>Pretty good with some flaws.
10821<>xx<>Le Thai is a strange one to me, I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I don't mind eating there often (mostly because I live across the street), its better than most all restaurants around it, and its a pleasant dining esperience overall - it just doesn't get me that excited.
10822<>xx<>I've been here a few times and I've had the Pad Kee Mow, the Pad Thai, and the Awesome Noodles dishes.
10823<>xx<>The meat choices are beef, pork, chicken, or tofu.
10824<>xx<>I wasn't crazy about the Awesome Noodles, a bit too bland for me.
10825<>xx<>The Pad Kee Mow might be my fav of the three, but the Pad Thai is also good.
10826<>xx<>I think the noodles are a tad over-cooked and the meat is typically a bit too dry.
10827<>xx<>Not enough to make me dislike the meal, but still noticeable detractors.
10828<>xx<>There is also a pork jerkey on a stick type appetizer that i wasn't crazy about, too fatty/rubbery for my taste.
10829<>xx<>The meal selections are tiny, which isn't the end of the world, but there could be a bit more.
10830<>xx<>They use the same noodles for each dish and although different flavors, each dish seems omewhat similar for that reason.
10831<>xx<>I like the selection of beer and saki, especially the saki.
10832<>xx<>The atmosphere is kinda cool, with trendy inside and outside seating, but the inside area is really cramped with tables squeezed next to each other.
10833<>xx<>The service I've had has been hit and miss.
10834<>xx<>At times its been very good, and other times I'be been left alone for too long without refills or check ups.
10835<>xx<>I wouldn't go as far as to say that the service is poor, they are friendly enough, it's just inconsistant.
10836<>xx<>Pricing is very reasonable.
10837<>xx<>Location is good because Fremont has really been missing decent quality restaurants    In the end i would never steer someone away from dining at Le Thai, it's just that i wouldn't rave about it either.
10838<>xx<>The Fremont East District is slowly turning around.
10839<>xx<>There are new businesses opening up and some like Le Thai are thriving.
10840<>xx<>The atmosphere here is laid back cool and the people here are welcoming.
10841<>xx<>This place also has the second best Phad Thai I've ever had.
10842<>xx<>To be honest with you,  I had a bowl of it early Thursday afternoon and I almost went back to get more for dinner but I resisted...until lunch the next day.
10843<>xx<>I seriously couldn't get it off my mind.
10844<>xx<>The food here is great.
10845<>xx<>$13 will get you a plenty big portion that has that unique mix of flavors I want in Phad Thai.
10846<>xx<>I ordered the spice level 4 but Ashley the bartender recommended 2 ("mild") out of 5 with some extra chilies on the side.
10847<>xx<>Long story short, the next day I easily handled the level 4 ("spicy") and the next time I'm going all the way to 5 ("Thai spicy"),  I know most people going to downtown Las Vegas usually stay under the protective canopy of The Fremont Street Experience, which is a blast.
10848<>xx<>But for those adventurous souls that like to step out of the box and explore - you owe it to yourself to stop here and get yourself a bowl of Phad Thai.
10849<>xx<>Tip:  This place is BUSY so be prepared to be on a wait at lunch and dinner times.
10850<>xx<>Oh yes, this little joint deserves the praise!
10851<>xx<>Frozen and hungry, we were searching for something warm and spicy.
10852<>xx<>We found Le Thai, a small and casual gem.
10853<>xx<>Tiny dining area, so we had to eat outside in jackets in a screened patio area with heaters( a small inconvenience).
10854<>xx<>I eat Thai often(NY, NJ), but this was one of the best and even slightly unique.
10855<>xx<>The Penang curry tasted like homemade- mild and creamy, and transparent flavors(no mystery sauces).
10856<>xx<>Kee Mao was not sticky like other places but actually juicy and refreshing with all the veggies.
10857<>xx<>I also had a salad, I think pork with lettuce and dressing...forgot the name, but was nice and lemony.
10858<>xx<>However, they missed the soooo delicious peanuts.
10859<>xx<>They should consider adding them for another layer of flavor and texture.
10860<>xx<>Thai iced tea could have used less brewing or steeping time, it was a bit bitter.
10861<>xx<>Thumbs up Le Thai!
10862<>xx<>Oh, a little fun fact: all their menu sections are prefixed with Le.
10863<>xx<>So it will say Le Beverage, Le other Beverage, Le Salad.
10864<>xx<>I found it amusing and nice.
10865<>xx<>Don't miss this small intimate gem.
10866<>xx<>Delicious spicy dishes and friendly staff.
10867<>xx<>Prices are very reasonable.
10868<>xx<>Yum, Yum, Yum is all I can say!
10869<>xx<>Best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to, and I've been to a few.
10870<>xx<>The decor itself is accommodating to the ambiance in the restaurant.
10871<>xx<>The bar is elegant and have the best drinks there, even though I only drink beer, it's the best to have with the meats they serve.
10872<>xx<>They have over 10 choices of meat.
10873<>xx<>From filet mignon to lamb to rabbit and they are all cooked perfectly.
10874<>xx<>Along with the selection of meats they have their buffet of sides, salads and desserts.
10875<>xx<>The price is very inexpensive $35-50 for the quality of their food, so you will be completely satisfied with the whole meal and if you're in great company, it makes the whole experience that much better!
10876<>xx<>Definitely a 5+ star recommendation!
10877<>xx<>I don't give anyone a 5, but this was to die for.
10878<>xx<>Scrumptous.
10879<>xx<>The service was impeccible.
10880<>xx<>Lovely, lovely time.
10881<>xx<>Thank you !
10882<>xx<>This is totally the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas!!!
10883<>xx<>Actually my favorite in the whole world but I have only been to Texas De Brazil, the one inside Planet Hollywood and Rodizio Grill in Utah.
10884<>xx<>I suppose I do not have very many to compare it to but I can still compare.
10885<>xx<>It is located right off Flamingo so it is accessible.
10886<>xx<>Ricky is their group sales manager and she is most helpful.
10887<>xx<>Currently I am shaking and sweating from all the meat.
10888<>xx<>Do not, I repeat do not let that detract you from fogo de chao.
10889<>xx<>The servers are fast, prompt and polite.
10890<>xx<>The food is absolutely amazing.
10891<>xx<>I even enjoyed the drinks here.
10892<>xx<>I didn't know what I wanted, so I asked for something sweet and fruity.
10893<>xx<>It was glorious.
10894<>xx<>Re-born again Fogo virgin reporting at duty:  You know the scene in Rush Hour where Jacky Chan and Chris Tucker walk into the "salon" with the AYCE sea of women....well thats how I felt like at Fogo de Chao except I don't have to feel guilty and I can live to tell you about my full out meat-gasm experience.
10895<>xx<>First, the salad bar is massive to say the least with smoked salmon, variety of prosciutto, cheeses, salads, and green and white asparagus.
10896<>xx<>But follow the advice: 1 plate only!
10897<>xx<>You'll be excited but this is a marathon, not a sprint and you'll wanna save your room for the main event.
10898<>xx<>Don't punch yourself out like they say in boxing.
10899<>xx<>When it comes to meats, go with the lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, and bacon wrapped filet.
10900<>xx<>It's easy to wanna grab everything you see but a wise man once told me at a strip club- the key is to scan the room, take everything in, and strategically choose your meats; otherwise you'll be throwing in the towel before you know it.
10901<>xx<>The meats are well seasoned, delicious, serve how you like it.
10902<>xx<>If you like it bloody, then they got it rare for you.
10903<>xx<>The service here is exceptional and this growing brand of Brazil steak dominance is here to stay.
10904<>xx<>I was a kid in candy store.
10905<>xx<>My first experience was with Fogo nearly 15 years ago and I'm proud to say I'm a born again Fogo virgin!
10906<>xx<>The s/o and I have been to several Brazillian steakhouses, including Texas de Brazil, Pampas and a few located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
10907<>xx<>I've heard of Fogo de Chao for several years, but there was never a convenient location until I realized there's now a location in Vegas so, we had to check it out.
10908<>xx<>Very typical setup as the other steakhouses we've been to, as it features a buffet of various salads, cheese, cured meats, and a few hot items such as rice, potatoes and vegetables.
10909<>xx<>They also serve you a plate of plantains, fried polenta and mashed potatoes...the instant kind, not real mashed potatoes, for the price you'd pay you'd think they wouldn't skimp on quality.
10910<>xx<>The saving grace was their cheese bread, it was seriously the BEST cheese bread from a Brazillian steakhouse we've had!
10911<>xx<>What nice is that they'll refill it with a piping hot batch on request.
10912<>xx<>They had a variety of about a dozen or so meats, varying from the traditional Picanha (Top Sirloin), Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken wrapped in Bacon, and other cuts of Sirloins.
10913<>xx<>They also had a Rib of Beef, which is served cut from a cutting board but you have to specifically request it as it's not an item that they walk from table to table.
10914<>xx<>First off, avoid the sausage and even the chicken, you can eat that anytime, anywhere.
10915<>xx<>If all you eat is the Rib of Beef, do it, it's the only super darn delcious cut of meat they offer!
10916<>xx<>With that said, yeah, the cuts of the various beef were lacking in flavor, I almost wanted to ask for steak sauce.
10917<>xx<>Unlike other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, FdC did not serve Grilled Pineapple...if you haven't had it, you're seriously missing out, it just makes you enjoy the various meats even more.
10918<>xx<>My biggest gripe about FdC was the ambiance.
10919<>xx<>It was a nice, typical white linen type of steakhouse.
10920<>xx<>However, although I do understand the "meat guys" as I call them are running around from table to table, there were just way too many wait staff walking around.
10921<>xx<>It made the dining experience slightly unnerving that you'd get bumped into (which I did), get something spilled on you (almost happened, but observed it happening on the dining room floor, twice) and just sheer pandamonium.
10922<>xx<>It seriously was like a sea of people dressed in white shirts running around like chickens without heads.
10923<>xx<>We've never experienced that at any Brazillian steakhouse we've been to.
10924<>xx<>There was even a guy pushing a cart of liquor from table to table, which added to the chaos.
10925<>xx<>When we got our check, we skipped using the plastic, left cash instead and seriously beelined out of there.
10926<>xx<>Sorry, can't say we'll be back.
10927<>xx<>You can't go wrong at Fogo, Texas, or Via Brazil.
10928<>xx<>All 3 are very nicely decorated, staff is properly trained, and food is as good as it gets.
10929<>xx<>This was my first attempt at Fogo and here is what I discovered.
10930<>xx<>The salad bar is fresh and the choices are similar to Texas, however the Italian dressing tastes identical to a bottle of Kraft that you can buy at Smith's.
10931<>xx<>Not very unique like the balsamic dressing at Texas.
10932<>xx<>Nothing is labeled either.
10933<>xx<>It's kind of obvious as to what each item is such as lettuce, cheese, whatever but I still like to see the titles of each item being served.
10934<>xx<>No sushi, no lobster bisque, no soup at all at Fogo.
10935<>xx<>This is where I give the top honors to Texas for their salad bar.
10936<>xx<>Onto the meats...
10937<>xx<>I read a reviewer state the top sirloin was NOT the best meat at Fogo.
10938<>xx<>I found that hard to believe and after experiencing for myself, he was right.
10939<>xx<>But the thing is at Fogo, they call about 3 different looking meats "top sirloin".
10940<>xx<>One was the obvious one that looks kind of heart shaped with mild fat on the outside.
10941<>xx<>Another big chunk of meat was also called top sirloin.
10942<>xx<>It looked and tasted like Via Brazil's prime rib.
10943<>xx<>Fogo's garlic sirloin was the best of the 3 places.
10944<>xx<>I must give the best meat award to Via.
10945<>xx<>Side dishes are minor but I liked Texas and Via's banana's, rice better than Fogo.
10946<>xx<>Restroom was tiny.
10947<>xx<>Men's had only 2 toilets and 2 urinals.
10948<>xx<>Texas has a much better restroom facility.
10949<>xx<>Overall verdict.... me and a friend gave top overall to Via because of their super tasting meats.
10950<>xx<>Texas has the best salad bar but we are not there for greens.
10951<>xx<>This is really as good as it gets.
10952<>xx<>The food and service is great.
10953<>xx<>Can't wait to go back.
10954<>xx<>Attended dinner meeting in a private room.
10955<>xx<>Beautifully renovated interior.
10956<>xx<>Excellent ambiance, service and attention to detail.
10957<>xx<>Quality salad bar selections and savory skewered steak.
10958<>xx<>Great for personal and business, but go there hungry.
10959<>xx<>Good food and good prices, but wasn't the best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to.
10960<>xx<>The service was good, and the salad bar was exceptional.
10961<>xx<>I'll likely come back next time in Vegas.
10962<>xx<>Best patio in town.
10963<>xx<>Only visited once so far.
10964<>xx<>Food above average and the menu has a good variety that goes beyond basic bar food.
10965<>xx<>Service and the patio were A+.
10966<>xx<>The place just has a cool vibe to it.
10967<>xx<>Can't wait to go back.
10968<>xx<>Oh soo many microbrews to taste!
10969<>xx<>Small pitchers, traditionally warmer than your domestics.
10970<>xx<>The meat & cheese plate is a great app-yucca chips too!
10971<>xx<>Go when the weather is nice & hang on their back patio.
10972<>xx<>Cheers!
10973<>xx<>Five stars without a doubt.
10974<>xx<>My favorite spot in the Valley.
10975<>xx<>They offer dog treats from their spent beer grains.
10976<>xx<>Their beer is mediocre, but the service and experience more than makes up for it.
10977<>xx<>Plus, they let ASH members put their beer on tap.
10978<>xx<>VERY friendly to home brewers, and that's what counts!
10979<>xx<>For me, this is Heaven.
10980<>xx<>I stopped in here while on vacation for a pint with an old co-worker.
10981<>xx<>It was a fantastic bar and their beer selection was really good.
10982<>xx<>I can see this being a great neighborhood place to hangout.
10983<>xx<>I didn't try their food, but what people had around us looked really good.
10984<>xx<>I would definitely stop in the next time I'm in AZ!
10985<>xx<>Loving the Tucson beers on tap (Dragoon & Borderlands).
10986<>xx<>Also loving the chorizo & potato flatbread.
10987<>xx<>I was scared there'd be too much potato but was happy to find out it didn't overwhelm the flatbread.
10988<>xx<>Extra points for the arugula sprinkled on top.
10989<>xx<>Can't wait to come back.
10990<>xx<>Industrial style, yet upscale brewery.
10991<>xx<>With trendy food.
10992<>xx<>That let's your doggy come.
10993<>xx<>No light beers for lightweights.
10994<>xx<>We tried the Rita pizza and a taco plate.
10995<>xx<>Both were fine but I couldn't get by the prices.
10996<>xx<>I realize I am in a trendy Arcadia place where my doggy gets free biscuits.
10997<>xx<>The Scottsdale Blonde brew was great, we finished off a pitcher.
10998<>xx<>I didn't care for the pizza, it was a spray of pesto and some cheeses over a so-so flat bread.
10999<>xx<>the bartended seemed disinterested in us.
11000<>xx<>Worst part is the dang valet.
11001<>xx<>This place is the Arcadia version of Postino/Vig.
11002<>xx<>You get the good and the bad with some menu gems.
11003<>xx<>Bring your wallet and a full bank account.
11004<>xx<>My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out.
11005<>xx<>The service was great and I liked the wide open space.
11006<>xx<>We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed.
11007<>xx<>We ordered the green chile dip appetizer.
11008<>xx<>I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket.
11009<>xx<>He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why.
11010<>xx<>It was quite good.
11011<>xx<>My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal.
11012<>xx<>And it was a "small plate."
11013<>xx<>I wasn't the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off.
11014<>xx<>Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos.
11015<>xx<>One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer.
11016<>xx<>A little time in between would have been good - but I'll take that over slow service any day.
11017<>xx<>I'm giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential.
11018<>xx<>I'll be back to try something else!
11019<>xx<>Truly don't appreciate the pathetic TEASE they have by naming this place with initials, yet refusing to tell us what they actually mean.
11020<>xx<>If there isn't a clear meaning, then you're lame for having a name like this.
11021<>xx<>Please, drop the act.
11022<>xx<>They don't brew their own beers as of now.
11023<>xx<>They're contracted out by someone else (Grand Canyon I think, which doesn't have a good reputation for award winning beers).
11024<>xx<>Large tap selection, but sadly it is heavily skewed heavily towards Arizona beers which are not exactly highly rated, nor sought after by those really into great craft beer.
11025<>xx<>Luckily they still have some of the better regional beers from California & Colorado (among others) on tap as well.
11026<>xx<>Food is extremely high in price, excluding happy hour.
11027<>xx<>Maybe they'll do better than the failed German places in this location before it.
11028<>xx<>My wife and I ate here last night, and it was terrific.
11029<>xx<>Ordered the Arizona burger, pink, it was delicious.
11030<>xx<>And the sweet potato fries were perfect.
11031<>xx<>My wife ordered the Brisket sandwich, and let me tell you, it convinced me to come back for the all you can eat BBQ they have on Sundays.
11032<>xx<>The beer selection is top notch with around 12 from local sources.
11033<>xx<>Inside is huge, and they have nice outside seating as well.
11034<>xx<>You can tell by how crowded it was that its a favorite with a lot of people.
11035<>xx<>Perfection.
11036<>xx<>Excellent beer selection with lots of AZ beers.
11037<>xx<>Great patio with a nice view of Camelback Mountain.
11038<>xx<>Straightforward food with fresh, tasty ingredients.
11039<>xx<>Brunch with a beer?
11040<>xx<>My kind of people.
11041<>xx<>Everytime I go, I like it even more.
11042<>xx<>Yelp needs a new star rating for this place.
11043<>xx<>Recently opened an office down the street and stopped in to get some lunch.
11044<>xx<>The place is simple.
11045<>xx<>Large menu on the wall, order counter, self serve soda machine.
11046<>xx<>But that's not what makes them great.
11047<>xx<>I ordered a brisket sandwich.
11048<>xx<>WOW.
11049<>xx<>It was awesome.
11050<>xx<>I have been back every week sense that first visit and have tried many different menu items.
11051<>xx<>Each one has been great.
11052<>xx<>If you like food, you have to eat here.
11053<>xx<>Don't be to choosy, everything is worth trying.
11054<>xx<>This place is GOOD!
11055<>xx<>AT least the rib tips corn fritters and beans anyway.
11056<>xx<>Brought a friend who thought it was great too!
11057<>xx<>So sad I haven't been here sooner, but so happy now :) I'll definitely be coming here for BBQ from now on!
11058<>xx<>!
11059<>xx<>Made the mistake of showing up right before closing.
11060<>xx<>Ordered the trio.
11061<>xx<>The chicken was like beef jerky and dry, I guess from sitting all day.
11062<>xx<>The brisket was good and the ribs were pretty good.
11063<>xx<>I drove a long ways to get there and when I got home there was no sauce on the meat.
11064<>xx<>My friends were pretty let down by that.
11065<>xx<>Made a special trip to get there which I won't do again.
11066<>xx<>The best BBQ in Las Vegas?
11067<>xx<>Not even close.
11068<>xx<>I was really looking forward to trying this spot, I had it in my bookmarks forever!
11069<>xx<>But unfortunately my mind wasn't quite as blown as I had expected.
11070<>xx<>Perhaps I didn't do enough yelp researching to make an educated order.
11071<>xx<>I got the pulled pork and hotlinks with mac and cheese and the corn fritters.
11072<>xx<>The pulled pork and corn fritters were really good, and I love there bbq sauce, but I really didn't care for the hot links or mac n cheese.
11073<>xx<>I do want to go back and try some of the more recommended items.
11074<>xx<>To end on a high note, their customer service and hospitality was awesome!
11075<>xx<>This place is kind of located in a sketchy area so I have to admit I was a little intimidated walking in for the first time, but everyone was super welcoming and friendly.
11076<>xx<>Allow me to begin with " ummmmmhmmmm, that bbq is so good it will make your shoes fall off!"
11077<>xx<>Or something like that from my time in the deep south.
11078<>xx<>I've decided to try one item at a time, starting with pulled pork.
11079<>xx<>I ordered for carry out, and had to stand around until my "table" was up for service.
11080<>xx<>There does not seem to be a distinguishing of take away orders vs table service, so expect to wait.
11081<>xx<>The only area in which to do so is a service station and I had to keep moving about.
11082<>xx<>The pulled pork was worth the travel and wait time.
11083<>xx<>The meat is tender but holds together.
11084<>xx<>It has an intense smoke flavor and mild flavorful sauce.
11085<>xx<>I'm thrilled to have ordered 1lb so I can pig out and still have some to share.
11086<>xx<>Go here.
11087<>xx<>Great BBQ spot near the strip, but not on the strip.
11088<>xx<>its a small place so make sure you spot the grill outside the parking lot.
11089<>xx<>Staff is very friendly, food came out quick and it was delicious!!!
11090<>xx<>A must try!
11091<>xx<>The food was soooo good.
11092<>xx<>The meat was tender and the sides were delicious.
11093<>xx<>I ordered the brisket and rib combo and it did not disappoint.
11094<>xx<>Staff was friendly, attentive,  and courteous.
11095<>xx<>Good as it gets BBQ with excellent sides - served by friendly staff who get it out to you promptly.
11096<>xx<>Ambiance is only cause for concern, but who cares when the food is so good!
11097<>xx<>Odds are you will become a regular customer!
11098<>xx<>Best BBQ!!!
11099<>xx<>Must go!!!
11100<>xx<>They have all you can eat BBQ.
11101<>xx<>And it's not crappy buffet style.
11102<>xx<>It's made to order every single time!!!
11103<>xx<>Definitely great to come with friends and family!!
11104<>xx<>Ordered the beef rib and the meat is falling off the bone.
11105<>xx<>Short ribs too.
11106<>xx<>And their seafood is delicious.
11107<>xx<>If I could add more stars for this review I would.
11108<>xx<>Let me be brief.
11109<>xx<>If you are in Vegas and you have a soul, go to Rollin Smoke and let them satisfy you.
11110<>xx<>Their BBQ is possibly the best I've ever had.
11111<>xx<>The beef ribs are out of this world.
11112<>xx<>Lord, the Jalapeño cole slaw?!?
11113<>xx<>and those cream corn poppers?!?
11114<>xx<>?...need I say more?
11115<>xx<>It's a hidden gem just off the strip.
11116<>xx<>Plenty of parking and seating inside.
11117<>xx<>The service is great, everyone is friendly.
11118<>xx<>I've been three times now and the last time I decided to be a hero and take an order back to my family in LA.
11119<>xx<>The waiters carefully packed my meal in a foil carrier and even added dessert as a bonus.
11120<>xx<>I've had the pleasure of meeting the chef and his wife, they are very passionate about their restaurant and you can taste it in the food.
11121<>xx<>I LOVE THIS PLACE.
11122<>xx<>YOU MUST VISIT....thank me later.
11123<>xx<>I can no longer visit my grandparents in Vegas without stopping here...oh and maybe hitting a slot machine or two ;)
11124<>xx<>Perfect hashbrowns.
11125<>xx<>And dear god, the Carrot cake pancakes.... Mmmmmm.
11126<>xx<>I think I died and went to breakfast heaven!
11127<>xx<>Every weekend I consider driving from Southern California to Vegas just for the Carrot Cake Pancakes.
11128<>xx<>I was very excited to try this place out since I've heard so many good things.
11129<>xx<>Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.
11130<>xx<>Let's start off with the service...I personally did not find the workers to be friendly.
11131<>xx<>The hostess was very pushy when asking where the rest of my party was when they were right outside of the door!
11132<>xx<>I only found one waitress to be friendly (I forgot to ask for her name) As for the food we got the red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice, and Mac salad.
11133<>xx<>Their red velvet was just ok, I honestly think IHOP's is better.
11134<>xx<>It just seemed a little cakey if you ask me.
11135<>xx<>The adobo fried rice was just ok and a bit on the salty side.
11136<>xx<>As for the Mac salad it had no taste, it was bland.
11137<>xx<>I would rather have Aloha kitchens Mac salad.
11138<>xx<>So with that being said I won't be going back anytime soon.
11139<>xx<>I thought long & hard to come up with a reason to not give a five star rating, but really I just can't come up with one!
11140<>xx<>The hostesses were kind & professional, we were seated quicker than told, our server was attentive, but not overbearing, the food was cooked well & tasted amazing, the place appeared clean (except there was a small amount of coffee that had spilled in the creamer bowl & that bothered me, but they were creamer cups so no biggie) & we were able to get our check & pay quickly.
11141<>xx<>All around a really great experience.
11142<>xx<>I bookmarked it so when we come back to Vegas we can return!
11143<>xx<>.....for more lemon ricotta pancakes!!
11144<>xx<>!
11145<>xx<>Listen to your YELP friends, people.
11146<>xx<>This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES.
11147<>xx<>My girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth.
11148<>xx<>She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot.
11149<>xx<>It was semi crowded by the time we got there.
11150<>xx<>They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes.
11151<>xx<>We aren't picky, so we took it!
11152<>xx<>(One star here for under-promising and over-achieving.
11153<>xx<>BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires.
11154<>xx<>This is great, in my opinion.
11155<>xx<>Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.)
11156<>xx<>Ashley ordered the red velvet pancakes.
11157<>xx<>She knew what she was getting before we even got there.
11158<>xx<>I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it).
11159<>xx<>Let me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great.
11160<>xx<>The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special.
11161<>xx<>The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me.
11162<>xx<>However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else.
11163<>xx<>The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag.
11164<>xx<>However, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life.
11165<>xx<>Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup.
11166<>xx<>They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS.
11167<>xx<>My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes.
11168<>xx<>MMMM.
11169<>xx<>So, seriously guys, when a restaurant names themselves after PANCAKES and specialize in PANCAKES, don't order something other than PANCAKES.
11170<>xx<>:)
11171<>xx<>Awesome breakfast.
11172<>xx<>We arrived around 8 am on last Saturday..no wait.
11173<>xx<>Good timing...there was a steady stream of customers while we ate.
11174<>xx<>Our server was super sweet and attentive.
11175<>xx<>I had the bacon and eggs, with an upgrade to the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.
11176<>xx<>The BF had the Piglet Skillet.
11177<>xx<>Boy, do you get your money's worth!!!
11178<>xx<>The breakfast potatoes were crispy, perfectly seasoned and delicious.
11179<>xx<>The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were perfect compliment - not too heavy, leaning towards a delicious crepe.
11180<>xx<>We both had food to take home but it didn't last - we ate the leftovers before lunch (we were organizing the garage and needed the carbs!)
11181<>xx<>We will definitely be back!
11182<>xx<>LOVE this place.
11183<>xx<>I need to get my red velvet pancake fix at least once a month.
11184<>xx<>And no better place than this.
11185<>xx<>This location has not done me wrong.
11186<>xx<>The wait isn't as bad as the other location, and all the food has been delicious.
11187<>xx<>From the different pancakes to the skillets and adobo fried rice, everything is yummy.
11188<>xx<>I liked the pancakes.
11189<>xx<>Everything else just ok. We ordered the Adobe rice and Loco moco.
11190<>xx<>Pancakes: banana fosters and red velvet.
11191<>xx<>I would give the place 5 starts on the red velvet.
11192<>xx<>Staff is really nice.
11193<>xx<>So my mom and I were looking for a great, inexpensive brunch spot on our way out of town.
11194<>xx<>We read all these reviews on yelp about the pancakes.
11195<>xx<>So we chose this place.
11196<>xx<>It was also my mom's birthday...
11197<>xx<>I love everything red velvet and had to have the pancakes, however the Cinnabon ones were also ones we wanted to try.
11198<>xx<>So we got short stacks of both.
11199<>xx<>In addition we split the Spinach and Bacon Eggs Benedict.
11200<>xx<>The Benedict came with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes.
11201<>xx<>I am pretty sure that most of the food is typical Sysco food, I'm not even sure the hollandaise is freshly made.
11202<>xx<>With that said however, the Benedict was delicious.
11203<>xx<>I ate one potato and pushed them aside, should have ordered the hash browns.
11204<>xx<>We did have a ton of food though so it wasn't like I was starving for more food.
11205<>xx<>Now to the pancakes.
11206<>xx<>I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust.
11207<>xx<>I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one.
11208<>xx<>I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm.
11209<>xx<>I was not so thrilled with the "icing" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom.
11210<>xx<>I liked it but I didn't love it.
11211<>xx<>I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better.
11212<>xx<>It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect.
11213<>xx<>Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake.
11214<>xx<>My mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes.
11215<>xx<>I can't.
11216<>xx<>Looking around at the egg dishes, they looked so generic and again, like Sysco food products.
11217<>xx<>I'd say if you want fantastic pancakes go there, but if you want eggs then pass.
11218<>xx<>Let me start by saying that I was happy to get off the strip for breakfast.
11219<>xx<>The Husband and I were very excited to try this place given their good reviews and their amazing sounding menu.
11220<>xx<>When we arrived, it was pretty empty, but I guess that's expected on a Monday and only a couple days before Christmas.
11221<>xx<>We were seated and I must have spent 30 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to get...it was a pretty big decision after all.
11222<>xx<>Finally, I decided to get what the Husband called 'the coward's breakfast' (since I just avoided making a decision by getting one of everything) which consisted of 2 eggs, rice with garlic/onion stuffs, and 2 hazelnut pancakes (I couldn't make up my mind....I call it the Most Winning Breakfast...but that's me!).
11223<>xx<>He got the orange creamsicle pancakes.
11224<>xx<>The pancakes were tiny, but filling.
11225<>xx<>Mine had got od flavor, but were served kind of cold.
11226<>xx<>The rice was not as delicious as I thought...it was garlicky, but didn't have any flavor beyond that.
11227<>xx<>The eggs were cooked well.
11228<>xx<>The husband liked his pancakes, but I didn't care for them.
11229<>xx<>The service was attentive.
11230<>xx<>Overall, it was fine, but definitely not deserving of the raves I had heard....just another breakfast place IMO.
11231<>xx<>Decent breakfast.
11232<>xx<>We tried a little of everything and shared.
11233<>xx<>The cream cheese sauce is a great touch.
11234<>xx<>If it's over 100 degrees outside, and I still look forward to eating at Ramen Sora, then I think that says a lot.
11235<>xx<>This is by far my favorite ramen to date; I love the Sapporo style ramen they serve here, with it's rich flavor and chewy, al dente noodles.
11236<>xx<>Having tried a few other spots in Vegas, as well as spot in LA and San Francisco, Ramen Sora remains my favorite!
11237<>xx<>The pork is always tender and flavorful.
11238<>xx<>Eggs are always cooked perfectly.
11239<>xx<>Plenty of topping combinations are available, but I usually go for the Nori Ramen; you're pretty much getting a Deluxe Bowl minus the extra pork for $1.50 less.
11240<>xx<>The miso broth is my favorite, and offers very rich flavors.
11241<>xx<>Not too salty, just rich.
11242<>xx<>Rich like Bruce Wayne going on a yacht with the entire Russian ballet.
11243<>xx<>The miso at other places is rich like Bruce Wayne doing the Batdance with Miranda Tate on the floor of a giant mansion with no electricity...it could be better.
11244<>xx<>Are those references even accurate?
11245<>xx<>I don't know.
11246<>xx<>But I do know that you should give Ramen Sora a try, even if you are already devoted to another ramen shop in town.
11247<>xx<>Take this with a grain a salt because I am very picky about my ramen.
11248<>xx<>I ordered the Spicy Shio Ramen.
11249<>xx<>The noodles were a good consistency, nice texture and everything.
11250<>xx<>The only thing I felt had an issue was the Shio broth, yes I know Shio means salt and that is a very bland broth but it wasn't very flavorful to me.
11251<>xx<>There wasn't much depth to it even with the spicy sauce it had.
11252<>xx<>The hubby liked the Shoyu Ramen though so I can't say it was all bad.
11253<>xx<>Just wish the Shio broth had more oomph to it.
11254<>xx<>My husband and I wanted to try a new ramen place and he'd read reviews about this one.
11255<>xx<>When we stopped in, the place was crowded but we managed to get a seat.
11256<>xx<>After a good look at the menu, our orders were placed.
11257<>xx<>I got the shio ramen, it was small but flavorable with a couple of big pieces of chashu pork.
11258<>xx<>The half boiled egg was still slightly runny, and the noodle was what I call true ramen noodle, at least what I had been used to getting in Hawaiian Ramen shops.
11259<>xx<>Overall, a good bowl of soup, but it didn't fill me up, so either order extra sides, or make it large, or you're gonna leave hungry.
11260<>xx<>Out of all the ramen places in Vegas this is the best one!
11261<>xx<>When I go here I always have gyoza, fried rice and negi ramen.
11262<>xx<>All super delicious.
11263<>xx<>Fried rice is easy to make but it is rare for a place to make it well and his place makes it awesome!
11264<>xx<>Got the Spicy Shoyu Ramen which had robust flavor and perfectly hit the spot.
11265<>xx<>I have to say in a comparison, Ramen Sora is probably #1 on my list of Japanese noodle houses right now.
11266<>xx<>Will definitely be back!
11267<>xx<>The Skinny: finally!
11268<>xx<>a really decent ramen house in Las Vegas!
11269<>xx<>I would pass on the dessert though (4) service: went during the first week of opening, a little disorganized but it's still pretty good given the Japanese efficiency (3) value: it's not bad as long as you don't order extra toppings which seem relatively pricey (4).
11270<>xx<>We came here opening week to try out their miso ramen and within a few days, we were back for more.
11271<>xx<>It was really reassuring to hear a bunch of Japanese spoken in this joint by both the customers and the staff.
11272<>xx<>You know that likely this stuff can't be that far from legit.
11273<>xx<>Here's the menu items we have tried so far: miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, mini chasu bowl, premium chasu side order and a order of their mochi dessert.
11274<>xx<>Breakdown of the broths: the underlying broth has a robust, decadent pork flavour to it.
11275<>xx<>Throw in the miso ($7.50) or spicy miso, you have a well balanced bowl of homey goodness.
11276<>xx<>The spicy miso ($8.50) adds a judicious amount of heat to round out the taste without detracting from the underlying taste of the soup.
11277<>xx<>Very subtle and well done.
11278<>xx<>I think of the three broths, spicy miso might be my favourite.
11279<>xx<>The noodles are in the standard ramen style and cooked perfectly.
11280<>xx<>Slightly thicker than your standard fare, I really loved the mild chewiness of the noodle which speaks to its freshness.
11281<>xx<>Really, a mouth full of joy.
11282<>xx<>The egg was ramen perfection - hard boiled with a thin layer of soy permeating on the outside, a precise ratio of cooked to runny yolk on the inside.
11283<>xx<>Loved it.
11284<>xx<>Could have eaten at least three of those eggs alone.
11285<>xx<>If there is a weakness in the bowl, it's with the chasu.
11286<>xx<>Even though the chasu does have a good texture and flavour, it could be a little bit more melt in the mouth.
11287<>xx<>A little too thinly sliced for my liking, it is worth the upgrade for a few extra slices ($2) to make a more satisfying meal.
11288<>xx<>If it's your first time here, I wouldn't recommend getting a menma ramen ($8.50) or a corn/butter ramen ($9).
11289<>xx<>Considering the price of these additions to the regular bowl, it's rather expensive factoring in the relative cost of the product.
11290<>xx<>I mean, really, $1 for extra green onion?
11291<>xx<>You can buy 3 bunches of that in the Chinese grocery store across the street.
11292<>xx<>Stick to the extra chasu and maybe the tamago if you're an egg fan - you won't be disappointed.
11293<>xx<>We did try the premium chasu side order but was rather disappointed that it was served stone cold with some congealed fat on it.
11294<>xx<>That certainly detracted from the texture of the product and I would not recommend ordering it.
11295<>xx<>Instead, get an side order of the mini chasu bowl ($2.85).
11296<>xx<>The chasu, cut into chunks, is layered with negi (Japanese green onion) over rice with a light sprinkle of the marinating soy broth.
11297<>xx<>Very stick to your ribs kind of food and highly satisfying.
11298<>xx<>The chasu fared better in this instance given the way that it was served but again was not quite the perfect texture.
11299<>xx<>Regardless, given the price, it's really worth a try.
11300<>xx<>Finally, the dessert.
11301<>xx<>We tried their mochi balls filled with red bean and rolled in black sesame ($2).
11302<>xx<>Given the great quality of the dishes here, it really fell flat in comparison.
11303<>xx<>While the filling was okay, the mochi itself was overly dry.
11304<>xx<>I'd pass on this menu item because there are so many other great things to fill your belly with.
11305<>xx<>Overall, I'm so happy that this place opened because we used to drive all the way out to LA to get a half-decent bowl of ramen.
11306<>xx<>Now my husband can spare me the 4 hour drive there and satisfy his cravings at Ramen Sora (4).
11307<>xx<>I'm ashamed.........I cheated on Monta....
11308<>xx<>The original plan was to go to Monta for lunch but after seeing a group of people waiting outside in the 100 + degree weather, I went with plan B and headed to Ramen Sora.
11309<>xx<>Up until this point I had been reluctant because I didn't want to end up dreaming about Monta while eating at another location.
11310<>xx<>The decor is simple but definitely more spacious than Monta.
11311<>xx<>The broth is made of pork bones and comes in miso, shio (salt), shoyu flavors.
11312<>xx<>The miso broth is the most popular and the deluxe ramen and spicy miso ramen are the fan favorites according to the waitress.
11313<>xx<>I decided to try the miso ramen with extra charsiu.
11314<>xx<>Beware....all meat lovers....you must order extra charsiu or else you will only get one piece of pork unless you order the deluxe ramen.
11315<>xx<>Ramen Sora only has one ramen noodle option versus Monta which has the thinner and thicker noodles.
11316<>xx<>The noodles at Ramen Sora are similar to the thicker/curly noodles at Monta.
11317<>xx<>When the bowl arrived I was still a little hesitant and wary....but first taste of the broth I was pleasantly surprised by the rich pork flavor of the broth with a hint of sweetness from the miso.
11318<>xx<>The pork was adequate, definitely leaner cut compared to the version at Monta....but a little too salty in my opinion.
11319<>xx<>Since, I am a fatty at heart, I like the extremely tender pork pieces at Monta...the tenderness may be due to higher fat content =) Bonus is that Ramen Sora comes with an egg, without having to pay extra.
11320<>xx<>Overall, I would say broth and noodles are comparable at the two locations, definitely a difference in flavor but both are very good.
11321<>xx<>However, I still prefer the pork at Monta.
11322<>xx<>But I will definitely be back...especially if I don't have to wait in a long line =)
11323<>xx<>Ramen?
11324<>xx<>You mean, ramen noodles...the stuff you buy at the grocery store for like $.10 a packet?
11325<>xx<>No, absolutely not, it's nothing like that.
11326<>xx<>I quickly found that out after having dinner here with some fellow Yelpers.
11327<>xx<>This was my first time having ramen that didn't come out of a wrapper with a little packet of seasoning...and yes, I'm a fan.
11328<>xx<>A huge fan!
11329<>xx<>So, we came in here for dinner on a Friday night.
11330<>xx<>From what I read in reviews, I was surprised to see that we got seated so quickly.
11331<>xx<>It's actually a good thing that we did because by the time we were done, there was a line out the door.
11332<>xx<>This is a really small restaurant with limited seating, so if you plan to come here, get there early and give yourself a better chance of avoiding the rush  Since this was my first time eating ramen, I felt like a kid asking all our more experienced Yeeps what everything was.
11333<>xx<>What's a miso?
11334<>xx<>Corn and butter?
11335<>xx<>Hard boiled eggs?
11336<>xx<>I had no idea what was going on and while that menu is only a single two-sided sheet, there's no shortage of options.
11337<>xx<>If you've never been to ramen, I definitely suggest going with someone who has for your first time.
11338<>xx<>After much thought and questioning, I found out the Miso is kind of like the "safe" option and decided on Spicy Miso.
11339<>xx<>Wow, this stuff is delicious!
11340<>xx<>The noodles are plentiful and cooked perfectly, the pork is tender and having that egg in there is so good.
11341<>xx<>But the best part of it all is that broth.
11342<>xx<>It's rich and is so, so flavorful.
11343<>xx<>I literally wanted to pick the bowl up and drink it cereal style...it really is that good!
11344<>xx<>Let me just say, if you were questioning yourself on trying a ramen spot, stop and come straight to Ramen Sora.
11345<>xx<>I may not have much experience in ramen but I can tell you this place is worth the visit and I can't wait to come back!
11346<>xx<>Yum!
11347<>xx<>Excellent bowl of miso ramen; chashu pork was tender, broth was rich and hot.
11348<>xx<>Everything about it was about as good as ramen gets.
11349<>xx<>And the staff are super nice, all cheerful and quick.
11350<>xx<>I'll be back!
11351<>xx<>Menu was confusing.
11352<>xx<>probably will try the other ramen spot next just to compare.
11353<>xx<>Spicy options are limited.
11354<>xx<>Gyoza's weren't that good.
11355<>xx<>Ramen was mediocre at best.
11356<>xx<>All I can say is WOW!
11357<>xx<>I'm not sure if its a good wow though.
11358<>xx<>I've seen for many years now all the commercials on TV for Golden Corral that I had to try it for myself.
11359<>xx<>And considering there's so few of them in Southern California this was a must try.
11360<>xx<>I pass by the City of Industry Golden Corral every time I travel into Los Angeles.
11361<>xx<>And it's always busy.
11362<>xx<>The one other word that really comes to mind about my visit to Golden Corral is SODIUM!!!
11363<>xx<>Boy, everything was really salty.
11364<>xx<>To be honest, the food wasn't bad for a place like this.
11365<>xx<>I had the buffalo chicken wings (pretty good), the bourbon chicken (not good), fried chicken (good, salty), roasted chicken (good, salty), steak slider (dry and too hard of a bun), Southern style fried fish (fish was tender but soggy cornmeal breading), fried okra (same problem as the fish), and the pork steak (very good but salty).
11366<>xx<>Overall, I'd say it was better than I would have expected.
11367<>xx<>It sure reminded me of a Sizzler meets Home Town Buffet on Steroids!
11368<>xx<>!
11369<>xx<>Good for a full course dinner!
11370<>xx<>Especially when there is shrimp and steak.
11371<>xx<>Not good for lunch, where selection isn't really that great..  You know where there's a lot of food but nothing to really eat?
11372<>xx<>Like opening your fridge, seeing all the food, but shutting it anyway.
11373<>xx<>That's what lunch felt like.
11374<>xx<>Also, I definitely don't think it's worth waiting in line.
11375<>xx<>Recommended for: No lines + dinner [without high expectations] + lots and lots of hungry guys/girls + affordable price.
11376<>xx<>I finally tried this place one evening.
11377<>xx<>The line was long.
11378<>xx<>I had high expectations for this place, but sadly was disappointed.
11379<>xx<>The food didn't please my palate.
11380<>xx<>Perhaps I've been spoiled by Asian buffets.
11381<>xx<>Even though we were seated near the chocolate fountain, I didn't dare eat from it.
11382<>xx<>There were just so many people.
11383<>xx<>Just too many people for my comfort and I felt a bit dirty eating there.
11384<>xx<>Both adults and kids are so messy dripping or dropping food on the floor.
11385<>xx<>The staff were quick to clean up any messes.
11386<>xx<>The quality of the food was ok, almost like hometown.
11387<>xx<>I liked the strawberries because they were very sweet and I ate them by itself.
11388<>xx<>Most of the stuff I tried was ok. Perhaps I would give this place a try again in the future, but at lunch time.
11389<>xx<>Going there for dinner is expensive.
11390<>xx<>This was my first time.
11391<>xx<>I went with my family a party of 7 and first it was soo crowded the line was out the door.
11392<>xx<>I felt like cattle in a barn.
11393<>xx<>Once we got closer I saw there was another line inside it was loud and hectic.
11394<>xx<>Needless to say we got out of line and went somewhere else.
11395<>xx<>Didnt want to spend my Friday night at a Zoo
11396<>xx<>best buffet i have ever been too.
11397<>xx<>Lots of food there..
11398<>xx<>Delicious!
11399<>xx<>This place has a larger variety than Hometown Buffet but Hometown is easier to navigate since it has sections whereas Golden Corral is just one big row in the back.
11400<>xx<>The staff is very friendly but forgive them if they forget things since its hella hectic.
11401<>xx<>They share a parking lot with BJ's so parking can be frustrating, another plus for Hometown.
11402<>xx<>Golden Corral is pretty much a better Hometown but you cant go wrong with either one for mediocrity.
11403<>xx<>There is something for everyone in the family...,steak is great, fish also..,,and the cotton candy!
11404<>xx<>We're back!
11405<>xx<>we had so much fun the 1st time we came back for more.
11406<>xx<>As we entered, memories of our last visit begins to kick in as we pass the food stations to our table, I feel the excitement and my appetite ready to answer the call.
11407<>xx<>The overall appearance of the restaurant is clean.
11408<>xx<>The variety of "Home-cooked" food for one price is incredible.
11409<>xx<>Everyone will find something they like or they are not very hungry.
11410<>xx<>Huge selection of salad.
11411<>xx<>I especially enjoyed the cod fillet fish, breaded okra, sweet corn on the cob, the baked sweet potato wrapped in foil and the best brussel sprouts I ever tasted!
11412<>xx<>Sound familiar?
11413<>xx<>There is a bakery so the desserts are made from scratch and fresh.
11414<>xx<>I had a few marshmallows soaked in the chocolate fountain and finished off with decaf coffee.
11415<>xx<>Thoroughly enjoyed our 2nd journey.
11416<>xx<>Enjoy the photo's my friends :)
11417<>xx<>I have been to the  Golden Corral locations in Calif. Utah and Las Vegas and although I'm not a buffet person I am impressed with the amount of food and the selection.
11418<>xx<>First I must say that there was no line when we got there last night.
11419<>xx<>I was in shock about that.
11420<>xx<>But very happy considering that every time we go there is always a line.
11421<>xx<>With at least a 20 to 30 minute wait.
11422<>xx<>Last night my family went to for the Specialty night Wednesday is steak and wings.
11423<>xx<>I was disappointed they only had one flavor wings and I don't like spicy food.
11424<>xx<>So I had to pass on that.
11425<>xx<>But I got rave reviews from other people abut the steak.
11426<>xx<>I liked the Meat loaf and fish and the fried okra.
11427<>xx<>Still all in all plenty for everyone to find something to eat.
11428<>xx<>And the dessert bar is a sweet persons paradise.
11429<>xx<>And now they have cotton candy wow!!!
11430<>xx<>sweet, sweet.
11431<>xx<>I like that they feature different nightly specials.
11432<>xx<>And they even have breakfast now.
11433<>xx<>No more going to the strip for a buffet when you can go here for less and better variety.
11434<>xx<>I still give it two thumbs up.
11435<>xx<>And they also do birthday parties and have a room to accommodate you group.
11436<>xx<>I had one there for my daughter this year and everyone enjoyed it.
11437<>xx<>Also they bring a slice of cake for the birthday person.
11438<>xx<>But if you want you can bring in your own cake.
11439<>xx<>Not worth 30 for 2 people.
11440<>xx<>Place was kinda dirty.
11441<>xx<>I mean they sat me next to the vacuum and across the restroom.
11442<>xx<>Not to mention directly Under the ac I was freezing and my food was getting cold.
11443<>xx<>My fiancé brought me here last night for my birthday and we had an incredible evening.
11444<>xx<>We were impressed with our waitress, Jessica, as she coordinated a surprise from my brother in Cali...he sent us a bottle of champagne and she surprised us at the end of the meal with the dessert he sent.
11445<>xx<>She was very professional and her service was flawless.
11446<>xx<>Now to the goodies...appetizers: fried oysters, 1/2 dozen raw oysters, & shrimp cocktail.
11447<>xx<>All three were delicious but the fried oysters stood out.
11448<>xx<>The tartar sauce was so creamy and had a perfect balance...my honeyyy even used it on the shrimp cocktail!
11449<>xx<>For entrees, we ordered the Japanese A5 Kobe, Beef Wellington, Mac & cheese, & sautéed spinach.
11450<>xx<>The A5 Kobe stood up to it's reputation.
11451<>xx<>Buttery, tender, pretty much the best thing I've ever tasted...but the beef Wellington competed very closely and was worth all the hype.
11452<>xx<>The sides were just as scrumptious!
11453<>xx<>We killed almost every bite.
11454<>xx<>We added two butter poached lobsters because as an aspiring chef, I wanted to explore this technique from the best.
11455<>xx<>I was blown away by the execution of this technique.
11456<>xx<>You have to taste it to really understand but I can say it was the most indulgent and tender piece of seafood I've ever experienced (coming from the northeast, that's saying a LOT)  My brother sent us the butter toffee dessert and although we aren't big on dessert, we attacked this because it was so good.
11457<>xx<>We were both surprised when we looked down to an empty plate...again!
11458<>xx<>We will definitely return and had a memorable evening that surpassed my expectations.
11459<>xx<>Came here with a party of 6 recently and we were all amazed by the caliber of the service & the quality of the food - despite our already very high expectations.
11460<>xx<>The blue crab soup, beef wellington, complimentary bread, and toffee dessert were definitely the highlights.
11461<>xx<>The salmon and bourbon creamed corn were also great but not too memorable in comparison to the first 4 mentioned.
11462<>xx<>Our server was fantastic and my water was always filled.
11463<>xx<>Add in a glass of red wine and a bottle of passion fruit tea and bf and I were so stuffed for the rest of the night.
11464<>xx<>Overall, we had a fantastic experience and Gordon Ramsay Steak definitely lived up to our expectations.
11465<>xx<>Will be back in the future to try their other steaks!
11466<>xx<>Fantastic food.
11467<>xx<>The beef wellington just melted in your mouth.
11468<>xx<>All the sides we ordered were very good and EVERYTHING had truffle oil all over it.
11469<>xx<>Personally, I believe a little truffle oil goes a long way but I felt like the food was just drenched in it.
11470<>xx<>I mean... when I took a dump the next day, it smelled like truffle oil.
11471<>xx<>Just truffle oil.
11472<>xx<>Had a reservation but still ended up waiting about 30-40 minutes before being seated.
11473<>xx<>Then even after that the service was extremely slow.
11474<>xx<>Friendly, but very very slow.
11475<>xx<>The music was too loud though.. night club loud.
11476<>xx<>Would definitely return the next time I have $250+ to burn on one dinner.
11477<>xx<>I've eaten good steaks all over, and this was the absolute best!
11478<>xx<>Donovan's in San Diego has been dethroned.
11479<>xx<>The sides were just ok, but I have a new "best" by which to measure.
11480<>xx<>Went there last Saturday for dinner with my Mom.
11481<>xx<>My overall experience was great.
11482<>xx<>Did not have any problems with the reservations.
11483<>xx<>Staff were very nice from the hostess up to the waiter its A+.
11484<>xx<>Very knowledgable and explained every dish they served.
11485<>xx<>Bread and Butter -- they gave us a variety of breads.
11486<>xx<>Its not your typical french bread.
11487<>xx<>Loved the cheesy bread, and the roll with pancetta.
11488<>xx<>It comes with butter topped with sea salt (from hawaii) which is quite good.
11489<>xx<>We had pimms cup (sparkling lemonade) for our cocktail, and it was very good.
11490<>xx<>Very refreshing for a hot Vegas weather.
11491<>xx<>It comes with a slice of cucumber, apple, orange and a couple of blueberries.
11492<>xx<>Perfect cocktail for non-alcoholic drinker.
11493<>xx<>Salads -- i got the ceasars salad with scotch egg.
11494<>xx<>It was good but i forgot to mention to go light on the dressing since i dont really like too much on my salad.
11495<>xx<>Wished they put more eggs (quail egg) and not just a tiny piece on the plate.
11496<>xx<>Loved the garlic croutons but the dressing is just overpowering for me.
11497<>xx<>Ahi Tuna -- my Mom loved it.
11498<>xx<>I tasted a little bit of it.
11499<>xx<>The tuna was perfectly seared.
11500<>xx<>Very light dressing.
11501<>xx<>I loved it.
11502<>xx<>We did not order any other appetizers since we want to enjoy our entree right away.
11503<>xx<>32oz bone-in rib-eye --- Hah!!!
11504<>xx<>Very good.
11505<>xx<>Very tasty.
11506<>xx<>Very big!
11507<>xx<>It was my mom's order but i ended up eating some of it.
11508<>xx<>I prefer my steak medium and my mom liked it medium rare.
11509<>xx<>I did enjoy the part that was seared but the rest of it was pretty raw for me.
11510<>xx<>It has more fat than i expected.
11511<>xx<>Beef Wellington -- ordered this one to get the taste of his signature dish.
11512<>xx<>It was ok for me.
11513<>xx<>The beef was perfectly cooked, and tender.
11514<>xx<>the pastry was very flaky.
11515<>xx<>It comes with potato puree and some root veggies.
11516<>xx<>I think the red wine sauce was over reduced because some solidified on my plate.
11517<>xx<>It was ok but i will probably order another dish next time.
11518<>xx<>We wanted to have dessert but we are so full.
11519<>xx<>Overall it was a great experience.
11520<>xx<>Thanks for my fellow yelpers advising to order just the tap water than thr still water.
11521<>xx<>It saved me $9.
11522<>xx<>And also you may want to get a Total Rewards Card from them since they give you a much lower price if you have it.
11523<>xx<>From being greeted most cordially and professionally outside the restaurant we were taken through the 'Chunnel' which encompasses the bar as well on to our table...a maginificent booth which was one of four serpentine tables as if two S's were connected!
11524<>xx<>Services became stellar from the beginning from out water service by a charming man to being greeted by our warm and engaging server 'Dennis' to give us some highlights and offer us the cocktail 'I-Pad'...so cool.
11525<>xx<>As we were looking through the cocktails cyber-style, Jeff Eichelburger, the familiar Sommelier if you have dined anywhere nice in Vegas, poured some Champagne for my date and I and we breifly reminissed as we have worked together before.
11526<>xx<>We were in HEAVEN.
11527<>xx<>The steak cart arrived which offers the evening's choice of cuts on a circular device that looks like the London Eye, each platform in the circle with a mirror behind it to show the marbeling of each steak...jealous yet?
11528<>xx<>My dining companion who is a Pescatarian, opted for the Black Bass and I chose the bone in New York which is a large beautiful nearly 2in thick steak.
11529<>xx<>For starters we shared the fried oysters served in their shells with a lovely creamy cold sauce while I had the seared foie gras (which was like a small steak) and she had the heirloon tomato salad.
11530<>xx<>We attacked the oysters first and days later are still talking about how unctuous and bright and crisp there were...don't miss them.
11531<>xx<>My foie gras was meatier than you normally would have...less delicate...have to say I loved it being that way and the fruity drizzle de jour was lovely.
11532<>xx<>C. loved her tomato salad...every bite.
11533<>xx<>We left nothing including the 4 kinds of bread which range from crostini and foccacia to pinwheels of of swirled flavor that you must forgive me for forgetting....the bread rocks...that's all you need to know.
11534<>xx<>Entrees arrived and my steak was done to perfection and C's bass was beautifully presented...as if they filleted the whole fish and kept it in tact without the head but the crispy tail remained..cool.
11535<>xx<>The four sides we selected to accompany:  Sauteed wild mushrooms, sweet creamy corn with a cilantro cream dolloped atop, truffled mac n cheese and creamed spinach...all were delicious steakhouse standby's that were generous and completely wonderful...we had quite a doggy bag at dinner's end.
11536<>xx<>Desserts we shared were a warm sticky toffee pudding (decadent) and my chef friend sent out cheesecake with a huge mound of wild strawberry granita and melon and tropical fruit panna cotta...we ate as much as we could and they were all sumptuous!
11537<>xx<>Wines were paired for us by the aforementioned sommelier and they were  perfect for each course...a Sancerre and Napa Valley Cab.
11538<>xx<>C'mon...forgettaboutit!
11539<>xx<>All in all I am encouraging all to come explore and be pampered with stellar service and impecable steakhouse fare.
11540<>xx<>Gordon Ramsay Steak doesn't reinvent the wheel...but makes for a smooth ride to a fabulous meal.
11541<>xx<>I am not giving demotions for anything...right up to fabulous cappuccino to finish..rich and smooth.
11542<>xx<>One word:  GO!
11543<>xx<>You do not get off with a small bill at the end but dining at a famous chef's Las Vegas restaurant...how could you expect to.
11544<>xx<>We lived it up and as I said had a full meal in leftovers.
11545<>xx<>One bit of surprise:  No amuse bouche at the beginning and no petit four (garmandise) at the end...didn't seem to matter but just a little surprised for a 'fine dining' steakhouse.
11546<>xx<>Went to Gordon Ramsay Steak for our anniversary.
11547<>xx<>It may have been the best meal we ever had!
11548<>xx<>The Kobe Rib Cap was the most amazing and flavorful piece of meat I ever had!
11549<>xx<>Everything was perfect.
11550<>xx<>Our waiter, Abraham, was the best.
11551<>xx<>The sommmelier  (wine guy) was very helpful and unpretentious .
11552<>xx<>A very high end meal, but worth it!
11553<>xx<>We live in Vegas and have gone to many, many restaurants and this is absolutely the best meal ever!
11554<>xx<>We will definitely be returning !
11555<>xx<>This is waay after the fact, but AMAZING food!
11556<>xx<>Go for the seafood tower app.
11557<>xx<>=D
11558<>xx<>Went here for dinner last Wednesday night to treat myself to an Early birthday dinner.
11559<>xx<>Have been waiting about a year to try this restaurant, so my expectations were pretty high.
11560<>xx<>My husband and I had reservations for 6:15pm.
11561<>xx<>We arrived a few minutes before to check in.
11562<>xx<>The hostess verified our reservation and directed us to our table.
11563<>xx<>as soon as the door opened it was if we walked into a loud nightclub.
11564<>xx<>The combination of guest noise plus the loud rock music playing created a very loud environment.
11565<>xx<>Definitely not on par with other Vegas steakhouses with their quiet jazzy vibe.
11566<>xx<>The hostess before seating us pointed to the ceiling which had a squiggly mess of neon lines on the ceiling.
11567<>xx<>She described that it was the hand movements of Chef Ramsay making a beef Wellington.
11568<>xx<>Were we supposed to be impressed like it was a Picasso painting?
11569<>xx<>It looked like something a 2 year old scribbles on paper with a crayon.
11570<>xx<>Had to be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a restaurant.
11571<>xx<>We were seated at our tiny table.
11572<>xx<>One thing of note is that the tables are open with no privacy, fairly small, and right next to the people next to you.
11573<>xx<>Definitely not a place for a romantic date.
11574<>xx<>It didn't matter.
11575<>xx<>It was so loud i could hardly talk with my husband anyway.
11576<>xx<>The waiter greeted us promptly and went over the menu in detail, and also handed us an I-pad type menu which had all of the cocktails and drinks on it.
11577<>xx<>This was actually pretty neat.
11578<>xx<>They then proceeded to bring us the bread plate.
11579<>xx<>Had a combination of Bread with lemon infused olive oil, a small roll that had bacon in it which was interesting and another regular type bread.
11580<>xx<>It came with a side of Devon shire butter topped with volcanic sea salt.
11581<>xx<>Overall pretty good.
11582<>xx<>The waiter came back with our drinks.
11583<>xx<>I tried the HK antioxidant cocktail with Veev Acai Liqueur, lemon and blueberries.
11584<>xx<>Very tasty with a kick.
11585<>xx<>Our waiter then rolled in with a cart displaying all of the cuts of steak.
11586<>xx<>they were displayed in a circle with a mirror behind each one to fully see the cut.
11587<>xx<>Unique and kind of cool.
11588<>xx<>It was just very difficult to hear the waiter, once again due to the blaring music.
11589<>xx<>Can't stress enough how loud it was.
11590<>xx<>We first ordered the appetizer of steak tartar.
11591<>xx<>This was pretty good.
11592<>xx<>It comes smoked with a quail egg and alongside yukon gold potato chips.
11593<>xx<>Ended up ordering the specialty, which is the Beef Wellington.
11594<>xx<>It came out cooked a perfect medium rare.
11595<>xx<>The quality was delicious, had a layer of foie gras around the steak followed by a delicate flaky crust.
11596<>xx<>Served with root veggies and a demi-glaze sauce.
11597<>xx<>My husband had the 24 oz.
11598<>xx<>Ribeye.
11599<>xx<>Again excellent quality, delicious and cooked and seasoned perfectly.
11600<>xx<>For the sides we got the fingerling potatoes which were pretty good, nothing really special.
11601<>xx<>The Parmesan crusted truffle mac-n-cheese however was like some kind of addicting crack.
11602<>xx<>So delicious, just could not get enough.
11603<>xx<>And last but not least had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.
11604<>xx<>One of the best desserts ever.
11605<>xx<>It comes out warm with a small container of warm toffee caramel sauce to pour over the top.
11606<>xx<>It comes with a mound of brown butter vanilla ice cream shaped like a stick of butter.
11607<>xx<>This dessert was the bomb.
11608<>xx<>Mouth Orgasm is all i can say!!
11609<>xx<>Overall the food delicious, savory and cooked perfectly.
11610<>xx<>The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable, however it was very hard to hear them and sort of lagged on waiting on us later in the meal.
11611<>xx<>So just slightly above average service wise.
11612<>xx<>Ambiance horrible for a steakhouse.
11613<>xx<>Extremely loud with the music.
11614<>xx<>Also make sure to get regular water at the beginning.
11615<>xx<>They try to trick you into "flat" or "sparkling" which is 9 bucks a bottle, and they don't tell you that up front.
11616<>xx<>The restaurant just tries too hard to be edgy and new age.
11617<>xx<>Unfortunately it doesn't work well at all for a fancy steakhouse.
11618<>xx<>Definitely could not have a romantic quiet evening at this place.
11619<>xx<>For the money you spend, you can do so much better at any number of steakhouses in town.
11620<>xx<>Hugo's Cellar, Del Frisco's, Top of the World all have food that is just as good or better, much better waitstaff and customer service, and above all 10 times better ambiance for a upscale steakhouse.
11621<>xx<>Over-hyped for the most part due to the chef.
11622<>xx<>I've been to GR restaurants in US & UK and there's a reason he's one of the best and produces that way.
11623<>xx<>The menu is awesome.
11624<>xx<>I finally got the beef Wellington and it was divine.
11625<>xx<>The sticky toffee pudding - one of the best desserts in your life.
11626<>xx<>There's a reason its award winning.
11627<>xx<>The service was fantastic.
11628<>xx<>Also had the bone marrow and we asked for bread and it came with real English muffins that were very rich but yummy.
11629<>xx<>The lobster tail was ok. Definitely a fantastic meal.
11630<>xx<>Just don't gamble in that casino.
11631<>xx<>Deals are beyond rude.
11632<>xx<>This place is amazing!
11633<>xx<>Im not really a burger person...
11634<>xx<>So when my hubby wants to go try this place, I was dragging my feet.
11635<>xx<>However, their bachi fish burger is so light and favorable, I'm so glad I decided to accompany my hubby.
11636<>xx<>They use cod, second best fish in my book (sea bass is always my first choice).
11637<>xx<>The bun is so soft and the toppings are very fresh.
11638<>xx<>My hubby got the pork belly bun.
11639<>xx<>It was a little to fatty for me, but my husband loved it.
11640<>xx<>It comes in a steamed Asian white bun, the favor is very similar as peking duck.
11641<>xx<>Overally we loved this place.
11642<>xx<>Definitely will come back next time we are n town.
11643<>xx<>Excellent food.
11644<>xx<>I had the Bahn Mi, my friend had the Black and Green and my daughter had the Shogun.
11645<>xx<>A bit pricy, but very, very tasty.
11646<>xx<>I will go back, but next time I won't let her order the Shogun at $26!
11647<>xx<>Haha, unless she's paying the bill.
11648<>xx<>Mind you, she had never had foie gras, so this was her big chance.
11649<>xx<>I dont understand the hype.
11650<>xx<>Service is slow and inconsistent.
11651<>xx<>Our server forgot to bring our drinks, we got fries and our pepper appetizer at the same time.
11652<>xx<>Who eats fries before the burger?
11653<>xx<>Our burgers were cooked well but goodness there is way too much going on in a burger to say it's tasty.
11654<>xx<>Too much flavor overwhelms, sometimes minimal is good.
11655<>xx<>Environment is hip and sleek.
11656<>xx<>The burgers are pretty good, if kind of overpriced.
11657<>xx<>But that's not why I'm here.
11658<>xx<>Normally I don't do this, but I had to deduct a star for their awful website.
11659<>xx<>Loud, obnoxious music coupled with every link being broken.
11660<>xx<>Every one.
11661<>xx<>Want to see the menu?
11662<>xx<>Continue listening to the obnoxious music (no off button either!)
11663<>xx<>while the site spins and spins and does nothing.
11664<>xx<>None of the other links work either.
11665<>xx<>It either immediately goes to an error page or, while you continue to listen to their obnoxious music, just keeps trying to load without doing anything.
11666<>xx<>A page full of just text would be better.
11667<>xx<>Plain, black text on a white background.
11668<>xx<>Here are our hours.
11669<>xx<>Here is our menu.
11670<>xx<>Thanks.
11671<>xx<>How can you have a bunch of restaurants with more coming and not notice these things.
11672<>xx<>It's been like this forever.
11673<>xx<>Oxtail fries......In short........YUM!
11674<>xx<>Oh my the burgers are awesome!
11675<>xx<>Cannot wait until the next trip over Thanksgiving.....who cares about Turkey when Bachi Burger is all you need!
11676<>xx<>Service is very good!
11677<>xx<>Lots better than the Henderson location.. Our server was very knowledgable about the food!
11678<>xx<>The black and green burger is a must try item as well as the pan fried edamame!
11679<>xx<>After hearing and reading so many good reviews of this place, I had to give it a try.
11680<>xx<>Unfortunately, I was disappointed.
11681<>xx<>I'll start with the good: -They have a good variety of burgers and they are big enough to split if you are planning on having sides as well.
11682<>xx<>(note: you have to order the sides separately)  -I split the meatless burger which was pretty good.
11683<>xx<>I could have done without the huge piece of fried tofu that was layered on top.
11684<>xx<>-The onion rings are SO good.
11685<>xx<>Definitely order a side.
11686<>xx<>They are sliced thin and have a nice crisp.
11687<>xx<>Here's the bad: -The truffle fries were soggy...would not recommend  -The kids menu is limited to 2 things: a $9 kids burger and an $8 "grilled cheese" which was basically a hamburger bun with melted cheese.
11688<>xx<>My kid took one bite and put it down.
11689<>xx<>The kid's burger was burned on the outside and pink on the inside but my other kid liked it anyway.
11690<>xx<>-They don't have any pickles!
11691<>xx<>They do offer a funky mix of pickled vegetables but it just didn't taste quite right.
11692<>xx<>-It's a bit on the pricey side for a not so classy joint.
11693<>xx<>The ugly: The service was pretty bad.
11694<>xx<>The waitstaff was very awkward and so was the manager.
11695<>xx<>Not personable AT ALL.
11696<>xx<>Absolutely no personalities.
11697<>xx<>I paid attention and not one person on the staff that interacted with our table smiled...not once.
11698<>xx<>I was with a group of 4 other women and 2 very well behaved kids.
11699<>xx<>They looked depressed and annoyed half the time.
11700<>xx<>When I told the manager that they should make it more clear that the kid's grilled cheese is not traditional and is on a thick bun he just looked at me with a straight face and said "okay".
11701<>xx<>He wasn't necessarily rude...just so bland.
11702<>xx<>The hostess that sat us needed to brush her hair...she looked like she just rolled out of bed.
11703<>xx<>She wouldn't even make eye contact.
11704<>xx<>I could go on and on but the bottom line is that your food can be amazing but, if the service stinks, you won't want to go back for seconds.
11705<>xx<>(This may have been an off day for this place.
11706<>xx<>The other reviews seem to be very good.
11707<>xx<>Whatever the case, it wasn't an experience I'd want to pay for again.
11708<>xx<>There are plenty of other burger joints in the sea!)
11709<>xx<>Pork Belly steamed buns ... Yummy !!
11710<>xx<>!
11711<>xx<>Simply put...
11712<>xx<>The food is amazing...
11713<>xx<>I love the miyagi son burger and the pork belly steam buns... Everything here is amazing and is different than any other burger place i have tried... Definitely a must visit to anyone coming to Las Vegas...  My only concern is the service, if it wasn't for the amazing food i would never come to this place.
11714<>xx<>The wait staff really seem to not be helpful although the managers seem to be making the rounds checking on the guests...
11715<>xx<>Such a shame that this place cant be perfect because of the wait staff...
11716<>xx<>If you wanna try something new and very different but dont want to risk not liking it, go to Bachi Burger...
11717<>xx<>The food was really great.
11718<>xx<>I had a few different kinda of fries and had the Ranin burger and KiKi burger.
11719<>xx<>The Kiki burger was is something I would recommend.
11720<>xx<>Although two people were after us and got our food first was only the bad part and it took them a while.
11721<>xx<>Beautiful desserts that taste great.
11722<>xx<>A little bit expensive but it's Vegas
11723<>xx<>The desserts here all looked very appetizing but for some reason, I wasn't too impressed by the ones that were recommended to us.
11724<>xx<>I'm more of a dense cake/cup cake person as apposed to a cake that's made entirely of a chocolate/white chocolate shell and filled with creams or mouses.
11725<>xx<>It ends up tasting too sweet and it doesn't seem to satisfy me unless there's actual cake or layers of something I can bite down into.
11726<>xx<>The hubby and I only ended up trying two desserts here, one was a chocolate, hazelnut mouse bomb and the other was a cheesecake, which at first I wasn't aware had not "cheese" filling but rather something airy and covered in white chocolate (which BTW, I don't care for white chocolate at all because it's not really chocolate.)
11727<>xx<>So anyway, the chocolate fountain on the other hand was very cool looking and it was a shame I couldn't try it.
11728<>xx<>The crepe station did look more appetizing so I may try that next time we're in town.
11729<>xx<>Overall, it was too sweet and airy of a dessert for me and a bit too pricey at about $8 bucks a tarte/cake.
11730<>xx<>But do try something here and maybe you might just end up liking it.
11731<>xx<>Superb pastries and a great stopping spot for a quick treat and coffee while taking in the Bellagio sights.
11732<>xx<>You really can't go wrong with anything here.
11733<>xx<>The food preparation is a spectacle in and of itself!
11734<>xx<>Follow me on twitter!
11735<>xx<>www.twitter.com/edsonhong
11736<>xx<>Amazing pastries, wow.
11737<>xx<>You will not be left disappointed.
11738<>xx<>My favorites are the bear claw and almond croissant.
11739<>xx<>Both are $3.95, which I think are reasonable for how well they taste and how big they are.
11740<>xx<>I really want to try the Nutella brioche, which looked delicious.
11741<>xx<>I went with three other people and our order was large.
11742<>xx<>My boyfriend ordered a panini and it took 10 minutes after everyone else got their food for him to get it.
11743<>xx<>2 groups behind him got their panini's before him so their system with orders isn't that efficient.
11744<>xx<>My dad also go an extra apple pastry and we got an orange juice that no one ordered.
11745<>xx<>Nothing wrong with free food!
11746<>xx<>The line takes a while but it's worth the wait!
11747<>xx<>The Crepes were defiantly worth the long line!!
11748<>xx<>The deserts were very good too!!
11749<>xx<>The fresh orange juice was good too!
11750<>xx<>The chocolate fountain was smaller then expected.
11751<>xx<>And you can watch them make the crepes.
11752<>xx<>Was def worth the time and the trip!
11753<>xx<>Price: Expensive for pastries but worth it  Food: I had the chocolate crepe, exotic crepe, a sandwich, and ice cream.
11754<>xx<>Everything was delicious.
11755<>xx<>Super delicious and top of the line ingredients.
11756<>xx<>There was a long line for the food but what do you expect from a super good pastry shop.
11757<>xx<>Everything I got was really good, fresh, mouth watery and overall amazing.
11758<>xx<>Overall: I would recommend you stop at this patisserie when you are in Vegas.
11759<>xx<>Everything on the menu is delicious and so so good.
11760<>xx<>Its nice to splurge on yummy-ness while in Vegas.
11761<>xx<>Ohhhhh chocolate!
11762<>xx<>Their crepes are DELICIOUS - both the sweet and salty ones.
11763<>xx<>Highly recommend this place - though it is rather expensive for such small portions.
11764<>xx<>Their coffee is insanely expensive, and not that good, but everything else is superb!
11765<>xx<>Their desserts and cakes are so pretty, you're afraid to eat it.
11766<>xx<>My husband even ordered a birthday cake from here because he knew how much I like their cakes.
11767<>xx<>I've only tried their sweet desserts, cake and crepes.
11768<>xx<>I have not tried their gelato (too busy with their other desserts)and I know nothing about their breads.
11769<>xx<>Who looks at breads when they have such pretty looking treats?
11770<>xx<>it makes you want to order one of each and eat them all.
11771<>xx<>After having crepes and 3 different dessert cakes, we ordered 1 more to bring back to the hotel!
11772<>xx<>and yes my bday cake the next day too.
11773<>xx<>On a 4 day visit to Vegas, we stayed at the Bellagio so I managed to have 3 days worth of JP.
11774<>xx<>This also means that I have 30 days of workouts to even things out but it was definitely worth it!
11775<>xx<>Raspberry Tart - Take a look at the photo I posted....how can you pick just one?!
11776<>xx<>But I closed my eyes and pointed at the Raspberry tart...and boy did that gamble pay off!
11777<>xx<>I am a raspberry lover and this satisfied every craving I could ever imagine.
11778<>xx<>Crepes - Tried the Forrest (Ham, Egg, Swiss Cheese), and the Apple Sensation (Caramelized Apples, Candied Pecans, and Whip Cream).
11779<>xx<>The Forrest was just ok, but the Apple Sensation was...well, sensational.
11780<>xx<>:)  Nutella Brioche - It's nutella.
11781<>xx<>A lot of it.
11782<>xx<>In a flaky brioche pastry.
11783<>xx<>Tasty - yes.
11784<>xx<>Life changing - not really.
11785<>xx<>Finally...as a nightcap, I tried the JP Road gelato (their take on Rocky Road).
11786<>xx<>Wow.
11787<>xx<>So amazing...I think there are also cookie dough (oreo?)
11788<>xx<>pieces.
11789<>xx<>The chocolate was so smooth and velvety....so worth it.
11790<>xx<>Tip: - Don't be daunted by the long line ups!
11791<>xx<>Not only are they worth the wait, but they do go by pretty fast.
11792<>xx<>Had breakfast here on the last day.
11793<>xx<>Already had the buffet the day before and wanted to give this place try.
11794<>xx<>It is convenient to the elevators to the rooms.
11795<>xx<>Sign says line starts on the right but to order crepes and omelets it is on the left before the cashier.
11796<>xx<>There is usually a line of people waiting to get bakery items and chocolates on the right so you can bypass them if you just want to order an omelet.
11797<>xx<>Had the ham and cheese omelet and coffee that came to around $16.
11798<>xx<>Omelet I think was around $13 and $3 for the coffee.
11799<>xx<>They make to order and you can actually see them making your omelette or crepe.
11800<>xx<>The omelet was large and plenty for breakfast.
11801<>xx<>Not sure how many eggs were in there and they seemed to have the eggs, ham and cheese preprepared in this plastic cup  and they just pour the contents on the grill.
11802<>xx<>I would guess it would be equivalent to a three egg omelet.
11803<>xx<>Eating there was much faster than going to the buffet but keep in mind the breakfast buffet is $19 so still the better deal.
11804<>xx<>But it you don't want to do all your breakfast at the buffet this is a good option.
11805<>xx<>The coffee as you would expect is French roast.
11806<>xx<>There are tables at the corner and all along the hallway so not too difficult to find a place to eat.
11807<>xx<>They serve on these thick plastic plates and the utensils are on the is shelf across from where you order the omelets.
11808<>xx<>This is an update to my previous post.
11809<>xx<>I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street.
11810<>xx<>MAJOR MISTAKE!
11811<>xx<>It was way over priced, crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance.
11812<>xx<>I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert.
11813<>xx<>I'll never cheat on you again Rehab!
11814<>xx<>I've been meaning to try this place out for a few months but my problem is that I rarely find myself in old town Scottsdale.
11815<>xx<>Well the stars aligned the other week when a charity event my wife and I were attending at Scottsdale Stadium was cancelled so I was driving around and spotted this place next to the parking complex.
11816<>xx<>I had the bacon burger which was huge and delicious.
11817<>xx<>My wife had the grilled chicken and loved it.
11818<>xx<>They give you a choice of two different size burgers.
11819<>xx<>I had the larger burger which I believe was 10 ounces.
11820<>xx<>I probably should have had the smaller one because I was completely stuffed for several hours after lunch.
11821<>xx<>The surfer motif is tastefully done and they have a ton of flat screens all over the place.
11822<>xx<>And a big THANK YOU to MANAGEMENT for not blasting the music.
11823<>xx<>It was definitely at the right decibel level so you can carry on a conversation.
11824<>xx<>In addition, I really dug the music as well.
11825<>xx<>They also have a great patio space so I'm sure this place will be rocking during the Spring Training season.
11826<>xx<>The service was excellent even though they were slammed due to that charity event being cancelled.
11827<>xx<>Our server explained that the kitchen was backed up.
11828<>xx<>It wasn't a problem for us and it was nice to get some communication from the server as well.
11829<>xx<>This is definitely my go to burger place in South Scottsdale.
11830<>xx<>This place is freaking legit!
11831<>xx<>I had the porkster burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato tater tots and spicy pineapple bbq dip and my partner in crime had the pb&j and bacon burger and both were out of world.
11832<>xx<>Now  I see what the hype is about.
11833<>xx<>Also, the service was great.
11834<>xx<>I would highly recommend it to anyone eating out in old town.
11835<>xx<>Bartenders = just annoying as can be - the type of people who you intentionally avoid eye contact with in hopes they don't speak to you - kind of like you would with a crackhead that is on a muttering, ranting binge attacking anyone who comes too close to them.
11836<>xx<>Boynerds on a self-manifested coolguy pedestal  dancing to their own tune (read: Rebecca Black's "Friday").
11837<>xx<>If you do sit at the bar, please make sur eto take note of the tool pool (read servers) that feed off every move the tenders make - like groupies at a One Direction concert.
11838<>xx<>Except it's all guys.
11839<>xx<>all guys.
11840<>xx<>Wings = Quite good actually, though the menu says they were supposed to come with celery, which for some unknown reason really upset my girlfriend when the celery didn't show up.
11841<>xx<>PB & J Burger = 2 words (food poisoning) - yep, thank you Rehab for allowing me to enjoy my first bought of this wonderful gem.
11842<>xx<>The idea is controversial, but from the common opinion from staff and patrons alike, we went for it.
11843<>xx<>Maybe they are good when cooked properly - but that's not what I got.
11844<>xx<>I got a hot pile of slop in the shape of a burger.
11845<>xx<>All I could taste was mushy,warm peanut butter and the juices of meat that I suppose was the burger.
11846<>xx<>My gf and I split 1 burger.
11847<>xx<>I ate 3/4 of my half, she ate 2 bites.
11848<>xx<>I already had a lump in my stomach.
11849<>xx<>We paid and got to safety.
11850<>xx<>Really awesome burgers!
11851<>xx<>The atmosphere was kind of hawaiian barish.
11852<>xx<>The staff are really nice and attentive.
11853<>xx<>We got the pb&j burger and I really forgot the second one.. he said it was like a big mac.
11854<>xx<>Pb&j- SO good, gotta say it has super umami flavoring.
11855<>xx<>Has to be the peanut butter and shiracha.
11856<>xx<>A warning though it can get overwhelming so I would share this.
11857<>xx<>Big mac?-  Nothing special just a burger with lots of toppings and overwhelming sauce.
11858<>xx<>So I guess not knowing the name of it isn't that bad.
11859<>xx<>It can get crowded so I'd come early if you dont want to wait.
11860<>xx<>I remember these people right behind me and up in my personal bubble.. felt so weird.
11861<>xx<>But I guess the awesome burger made up for it
11862<>xx<>Dog friendly and chill patio.
11863<>xx<>Burgers are awesome and they have pretzel buns.
11864<>xx<>A fine addition to the old town food scene.
11865<>xx<>Top quality burgers, beer, service and decor.
11866<>xx<>This is a relaxing place to hangout with friends/family.
11867<>xx<>Try the chicken wings and the wedge salad (not on the menu).
11868<>xx<>They also have a nice patio for the cooler months.
11869<>xx<>We gathered with a large group of friends for a birthday celebration.
11870<>xx<>Most everyone ordered a burger with a beef patty but I opted for turkey instead due to dietary restrictions.
11871<>xx<>I was shocked to find that mine was a perfectly shaped oval patty that was probably processed and thrown in a freezer before being heated and served to me.
11872<>xx<>It's not that hard or expensive to make your own patty and its a ripoff to pay almost 11 for a burger that wasn't made fresh.
11873<>xx<>I pointed it out to my server and she didn't deny my claims.
11874<>xx<>I also got the sweet potatoes which were nothing more than perfectly shaped frozen battered pieces resembling the color if sweet potato.
11875<>xx<>Needless to say we won't be back.
11876<>xx<>Really Good.
11877<>xx<>Went with a buddy and his couple of younger kids.
11878<>xx<>It was loud and they are loud.er.
11879<>xx<>Perfect place for them.
11880<>xx<>Food was good, drinks were good.
11881<>xx<>Had the Hawaiian, cooked perfectly.
11882<>xx<>Sweet Potato tots are always a good alternative to simple fries.
11883<>xx<>Will be back
11884<>xx<>I don't give many 5 star reviews but this place deserves it.
11885<>xx<>It's our second time in Scottsdale and for this second visit our first stop before we even checked into our resort was the Rehab Burger Bar!
11886<>xx<>First of all their margaritas are the best I have had.
11887<>xx<>Order one of those right away while deciding on what burger you want to eat.
11888<>xx<>I ordered a bacon blue cheese burger, with everything mixed in the patty.
11889<>xx<>Patty they make is huge!
11890<>xx<>Burger was cooked perfectly and went well with my drink and sweet potato tots.
11891<>xx<>Atmosphere inside is great also.
11892<>xx<>Very chill but a great bar atmosphere.
11893<>xx<>Only drawback is there are not one of these in Chicago!
11894<>xx<>4.5 stars!
11895<>xx<>Love everything about this place for the most part.
11896<>xx<>It has been on my bookmark list for awhile and finally got to try Eat last month.
11897<>xx<>Myself and 2 other friends came after the Color Run.
11898<>xx<>I was really worried the wait would be super long from the other color runners, we were told it would be half an hour, but it only ended up being 15 minutes.
11899<>xx<>I already knew I wanted the chicken fried steak since it had good reviews and looked delicious from the pictures on here.
11900<>xx<>I also ordered passion tea, which was okay I wish I would of ordered the strawberry drink instead.
11901<>xx<>I was very pleased with the chicken fried steak, the breading was well seasoned and it was a huge piece, a sharable portion.
11902<>xx<>The gravy and seasoned potatoes went with it pretty well too.
11903<>xx<>I ordered the house made chips instead of eggs and I was really disappointed because they look good in the pictures but didn't have the texture I was hoping for.
11904<>xx<>I also had the English muffin as my side, which was nothing spectacular.
11905<>xx<>My 2 other friends both ordered the chilaquiles scrambled eggs, they were both kinda whatever about it because they didn't expect it to be vegetarian.
11906<>xx<>I did I have a bite and liked it, but I always welcome vegetarian options in my diet.
11907<>xx<>The inside is awesome, hipster type of fare I must say.
11908<>xx<>I cannot wait to come back, I just don't know what I'll order because everything else looks so delicious.
11909<>xx<>I can't say enough good things about this place!
11910<>xx<>I went in on my own one morning.
11911<>xx<>I chose to sit by the window cause I wasn't sure if my back would allow me to sit on a bar stool.
11912<>xx<>Even though I really wanted to watch the action I ended up enjoying my view of downtown.
11913<>xx<>First of all Eat has the friendliest staff!
11914<>xx<>From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out the door everyone was helpful and really nice.
11915<>xx<>The service was spot on.
11916<>xx<>They never let my tasty cup of coffee get empty and even brought me more cream.
11917<>xx<>It was hard to pick what I wanted from their menu because everything sounded so good!
11918<>xx<>I decided on the corn beef hash.
11919<>xx<>I was glad I did!!
11920<>xx<>It came with chunks of meat and potatoes perfectly cooked with green onions.
11921<>xx<>On top was the best looking two poached eggs I've ever seen!
11922<>xx<>I broke them open and let all the yummy yellow yolkie goodness melt over my hash.
11923<>xx<>It also came with some tasty toast that I could not resist eating one piece of.
11924<>xx<>Definitely was an excellent meal to start the day.
11925<>xx<>Eat is a little pricey, but for the quality, taste and service it's more then worth it!
11926<>xx<>I'll be back again to try something off their lunch menu!
11927<>xx<>Yay for Eat!
11928<>xx<>This is a great addition to downtown Las Vegas that I really, really liked.
11929<>xx<>Across the street on the back side of Container Park it is ideal located.
11930<>xx<>The interior décor was great .
11931<>xx<>.
11932<>xx<>.
11933<>xx<>from the paintings, to the wall art, to the hanging guitars .
11934<>xx<>.
11935<>xx<>.
11936<>xx<>it was a pleasant change from normal.
11937<>xx<>I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and poached eggs .
11938<>xx<>.
11939<>xx<>.
11940<>xx<>which were amazing .
11941<>xx<>.
11942<>xx<>.
11943<>xx<>the beef, potatoes, and peppers were cooked perfectly .
11944<>xx<>.
11945<>xx<>.
11946<>xx<>and the contract off the poached eggs, made this dish a true delight.
11947<>xx<>The service was a little slower than I would have like .
11948<>xx<>.
11949<>xx<>.
11950<>xx<>and that was the reason for the deduction on one star .
11951<>xx<>.
11952<>xx<>.
11953<>xx<>but this place could very easily be a five star.
11954<>xx<>Where the place is located can feel a little sketchy.
11955<>xx<>Parking is only on the streets with paid meters.
11956<>xx<>Once you're inside the restaurant, you'll forget you're in downtown LV.
11957<>xx<>Food is really good.
11958<>xx<>Service was great.
11959<>xx<>Can't really go wrong with the menu.
11960<>xx<>I was a bit disappointed when they didn't have beignets.
11961<>xx<>The waiter gave me a weird look.
11962<>xx<>Lol.
11963<>xx<>So other than this being one if the most expensive bfasts I've ever had, it was good, but not worth all the hype imho.
11964<>xx<>The staff was great, courteous, and attentive and other than me getting chives on my sandwich after asking for none, I had no issue.
11965<>xx<>I was disappointed that they have a somewhat limited bfast menu during the week (no eggs benedict) and they discontinued the beignets, which were the two things I specifically came for, thus the docked star.
11966<>xx<>The coffee was good and they have Truvia which is a def plus.
11967<>xx<>I got the truffled egg sandwich, which was surprisingly bland for $12 and could have used some cheese or something for flavor.
11968<>xx<>I made my own concoction of syrup and tabasco, which I know sounds completely weird, but is absolutely delicious!
11969<>xx<>The chive potatoes were also a little too much on the greasy side for my liking.
11970<>xx<>The stars of the morning bfast show were the cinnamon butter strawberry compote biscuits, which were amazing if not pricey @$8 for four.
11971<>xx<>Maybe it was the fresh blackberries?
11972<>xx<>In any case, I don't know that I'd go back as you have to pay for street parking and it is in kind of a shady sectionof DT.
11973<>xx<>But, I did enjoy what I did experience for the pretty penny it cost.
11974<>xx<>Believe the hype.
11975<>xx<>FOOD: The SHRIMP AND GRITS were outstanding.
11976<>xx<>Perfectly cooked shrimp resting in a bed of (cheesy?)
11977<>xx<>grit goodness.
11978<>xx<>The grits are soft and compliment the tender shrimp and eggs.
11979<>xx<>I knew there was a slice of bacon at the bottom of the bowl and I considered asking for my bacon on the side.
11980<>xx<>Yes, I have no shame.
11981<>xx<>But I forgot and I'm so glad I did.
11982<>xx<>The soft thick bacon added texture and salt to the lovely dish.What was the seasoning on the grits?
11983<>xx<>I am embarrassed to say that I didn't slow down enough to think about it.
11984<>xx<>I tried to savor the meal, but ended up demolishing everything on my plate in record time.
11985<>xx<>I wish I could say that I'll try a number of other dishes during future visits.
11986<>xx<>But I won't.
11987<>xx<>I have fallen in love (maybe deep like) and have very little desire to explore the rest of the (intriguing) menu.
11988<>xx<>If you are unsure about the commitment to quality in this place, keep an eye out for the owner.
11989<>xx<>I saw her wave and chat with a few tables and then go right back to the business of keeping on eye on service and food.
11990<>xx<>In the short time I was there, I saw her giving instruction to a waiter struggling (or so it seemed) with a larger table, checking the hollandaise sauce, and preparing a few plates.
11991<>xx<>SERVICE: The service was excellent.
11992<>xx<>The host didn't give us an accurate (on any level) wait time, but he was warm.
11993<>xx<>Our waitress was friendly and attentive.
11994<>xx<>That's all I need.
11995<>xx<>VIBE: Earthy, eclectic hipster with an edge  EXCUSES: You've already read about the negatives--it can be loud, the meter situation is a hassle, and there will be a wait.
11996<>xx<>But the food is worth it.
11997<>xx<>The city could start construction on Carson and I'd just wear comfy shoes and walk a ways to get to those shrimp and grits.
11998<>xx<>If this is where the Vegas food scene is headed (quality ingredients, playful offerings, delicious food, good customer service, community atmosphere), I am excited to support the businesses leading the charge.
11999<>xx<>I'll be back to eat.
12000<>xx<>Just met Natalie.
12001<>xx<>Like this place!
12002<>xx<>The food was decent here but the service, decor and vibe made up for it pushing me to give it a 4 star.
12003<>xx<>Natalie is the owner and she is awesome.
12004<>xx<>Probably go back for her and the good tunes.
12005<>xx<>Went here on New Year's Day and so happy we did!
12006<>xx<>The website said it stopped serving breakfast at 11 but since it was a holiday they had a special menu until 2.
12007<>xx<>I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the chicken fried steak.
12008<>xx<>They were both amazing but the shrimp and grits took the cake!
12009<>xx<>The shrimp were huge and meaty and the sauce with the over easy eggs were to die for.
12010<>xx<>The chicken fried steak had an awesome spice to the breading and was cooked perfectly!
12011<>xx<>The only downfall to this place was no alcohol.
12012<>xx<>Probably didn't need it on New Year's Day!
12013<>xx<>The coffee was outstanding and the passion fruit ice tea was great!
12014<>xx<>It was not sweet but really good.
12015<>xx<>Would come back and try the truffle egg sandwich next time!
12016<>xx<>The food was not all that.
12017<>xx<>The customer service was just okay.
12018<>xx<>Don't get what all the rave is about?
12019<>xx<>?
12020<>xx<>I would have given this a five stars because the food is beyond very good.
12021<>xx<>The only drawback is the noise level inside if not too hot sit outside in the shade.
12022<>xx<>We split the Eggs Benedict and the cinnamon biscuit strawberry capote, both great taste and flavor.
12023<>xx<>I'm not a big fan of breakfast potatoes but these were great my wife didn't want the iced tea because it was flavored.
12024<>xx<>I like it really well.
12025<>xx<>Paid parking on the street.
12026<>xx<>Don't let this part of town scare you away from a great breakfast.
12027<>xx<>Great googly moogly do I love this buffet.
12028<>xx<>As a Vegas local I like to treat myself to a meal here several times a year.
12029<>xx<>It's super expensive (over $100 for 2) so make sure you are super hungry before you get here.
12030<>xx<>I have noticed a decline in the offerings over the years: no more freshly carved ribeye, no more crab claws, no more delicate Italian pasta dishes, and green vegetables have been phased out with more cheap carby sides like corn and potatoes -- but it's still a great buffet with great quality food.
12031<>xx<>The dessert station is a thing of beauty.
12032<>xx<>You can try mochi, homemade ice cream, crepes, chocolate dipped strawberries, cheesecake pops and more.
12033<>xx<>Oh nom nom nom.
12034<>xx<>This is THE place I go when I want to blow my low carb eating plan.
12035<>xx<>On my most recent visit I ate 3 baskets of the sweet potato tater tots all by myself.
12036<>xx<>Be prepared to wait in a long line.
12037<>xx<>Try to go at "off" times if you don't want to stand around forever.
12038<>xx<>And Pepsi fans rejoice: no Coke products served here!
12039<>xx<>My new #1 buffet in Vegas!
12040<>xx<>So worth the money!
12041<>xx<>I am updating them from a 4 to 4.5 stars...and here's why..
12042<>xx<>I came here for dinner, and the servers really impressed me, hence the upgrade in stars.
12043<>xx<>Meat Station: The guy (buff and tall black guy, sorry, I didn't catch his name) who was serving the meat was really friendly, and greeted all of his guests with a smile and booming voice of "Welcome to Bacchanal!"
12044<>xx<>And he was kind enough to look for a medium-rare lamb chop upon my request.
12045<>xx<>Excellent service and hospitality.
12046<>xx<>Seafood station: Raw oyster bar section, the guy working behind the counter was making sure that people weren't cutting in line and getting their rightful turn when it came to picking up the oysters.
12047<>xx<>It shows that the workers here care about quality and fair service.
12048<>xx<>Food worth a try for dinner Grilled Scallops Lamb chops (ask for medium-rare) Mochi Ice Cream (Black Sesame, a must try!)
12049<>xx<>Fried Calamari (looked good, but too stuff to have any)  I'd say best buffet in LV, thanks to the servers!
12050<>xx<>Rated #1 by USA magazine food was great although for the price I felt it should of been a little better and lot more selection.
12051<>xx<>The seafood was just great and fresh, the meat section lamb and steak my favorite.
12052<>xx<>The Asian selection was not enough and the Italian section was really lacking they only had 1 pasta dish where is the rest?
12053<>xx<>The dessert was just amazing love everything that alone will come back for :)   Love the setting and ambience not your average buffet.
12054<>xx<>If you have the money to splurge then go but if not you can go to other  buffets and have more selection.
12055<>xx<>Could have easily been a 4 out of 5...but bad service and horribly inconsistent quality of the food drops it down to a 3.
12056<>xx<>Everyone knows the deal at a buffet...quantity over quality.
12057<>xx<>No matter how much Vegas tries to reinvent the wheel with the promise of amazing quality, things always veer back.
12058<>xx<>The GF and I were excited to give Bacchanal a try while it was still new and for the most part we were very satisfied.
12059<>xx<>The afternoon was marred by a few annoying things.
12060<>xx<>First off here are the highlights: -Sliders - 4 out of 5 - very good -Beef brisket - 4.5 out of 5 - one of my fav dishes there.
12061<>xx<>Don't forget the Chipotle BBQ sauce -Shrimp and grits - 3.5 out of 5 - ...could have used a bit more seasoning but still very good -Crab legs - 4 our of 5 for first batch 0 out of 5 for the second - first batch was great.
12062<>xx<>Perfectly cooked and easy to eat (since they were sliced in half), the second batch were HORRIBLE completely over salted and inedible -Corn beef hash with a quail egg - 3 out of 5 - could have used more seasoning and a bit more corn beef but still pretty good -Creme Brûlée - 4 out of 5 - very good.
12063<>xx<>This was my GF's fave dessert -Chocolate Creme Brûlée - 4 out of 5 - this was my fav.
12064<>xx<>I liked the deep chocolate flavor.
12065<>xx<>Not overly sweet.
12066<>xx<>Really liked it -Gelato Bar - 4 out of 5 - Great selection.
12067<>xx<>I tried the Aztec Chocolate which had a nice spicy flavor with good hint of spice.
12068<>xx<>Thai Tea and Watermelon lime sorbet were also great too.
12069<>xx<>The consistancy of the gelato could have been better.
12070<>xx<>They were a touch on the lumpy or pasty side, but the flavors were good  The Mehs: -The entire asian food section!
12071<>xx<>Sushi was supermarket quality (not a compliment), the dim sum section was equally blah.
12072<>xx<>The steamed pork dumpling faired the best but was still just ok.
12073<>xx<>The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was gummy and the Pho was nothing special...or even really all that ok -Prime rib was just ok -Braised pork belly was funky.
12074<>xx<>It was really fatty so it wasn't the most pleasant to eat -Cheese cake was kinda powdery instead of creamy  And here are the lowlights: -Service was kinda blah.
12075<>xx<>There was only 1 guy bussing plates in our section so often they were stacking up -There was also only 1 waitress so getting refills on the supposedly bottomless mimosas or fountain drinks was hard.
12076<>xx<>We had to flag her several times.
12077<>xx<>-The dessert section had a display showing all the items.
12078<>xx<>When i asked the lady where the creme brûlées where she gave me and my girlfriend a good dose of attitude saying that they were on the other side -Our second serving of crab legs inedibly over salted.
12079<>xx<>It was so salty I actually spit out my bite.
12080<>xx<>Not sure what happened but me and my GF went at different intervals and both of our crab legs were inedible so the whole batch wasn't cooked properly.
12081<>xx<>Overall, not bad but still a little lacking.
12082<>xx<>We are definitely gonna try another buffet next time we are in town.
12083<>xx<>Great selection of seafood: oysters, crab legs, cocktail shrimps, mussels.
12084<>xx<>Dont forget their desserts though: mochi, ice cream, and all their little cakes.
12085<>xx<>However, there wasnt many varieties of sushi.
12086<>xx<>Came in at 4pm on Friday and we were seated right away.
12087<>xx<>The place started to get crowded around 5:30 pm and by the time we walk out, there was a long line waiting outside.
12088<>xx<>Diner is $43, a little pricey but worth it.
12089<>xx<>Although I was here Friday morning, I felt this place would be best buffet to me so far!
12090<>xx<>At this Vegas travel, I visited here and Wynn Buffet.
12091<>xx<>If Bacchanal is 95 of 100, Wynn is less than 70 even I visited Wynn at Sunday bruch when more variety food time.
12092<>xx<>So I will be here again when in Vegas at lunch or dinner.
12093<>xx<>I especially remember the followings.
12094<>xx<>- ramen and pho : broth is really tasty, but had to ask less than hafl noodle  - cocktail shrimp : 3 times larger than Wynn and aawwsm quality - little pancakes: looks good and delicious - ha glow : small and tasty - smoked salmon : best I have ever so far - all other things: more than average
12095<>xx<>I'm usually not a big fan of buffets so to give 4 stars is saying a lot.
12096<>xx<>Although the line seems long, it goes pretty fast.
12097<>xx<>I want for lunch on a Sunday and waited about 30 mins.
12098<>xx<>Although the price on the higher end, the food quality is worth it.
12099<>xx<>Lunch includes unlimited mimosas and champagne, juices, coffee and soft drinks.
12100<>xx<>The food selection is pretty good.
12101<>xx<>Everything was really fresh.
12102<>xx<>I really loved their seafood section with the warm king crab legs, clam bake, and shrimp cocktail.
12103<>xx<>To my disappointment, they only had oyster shooters and not fresh oysters even though they had oysters on display.
12104<>xx<>The taco stand was pretty awesome with a wide variety of home made salsas.
12105<>xx<>Make sure you try the mango habanero salsa.
12106<>xx<>They were very generous with the unlimited champagne and mimosas.
12107<>xx<>I heard they now have check in kiosks to minimize the lines and fresh oysters during dinner.
12108<>xx<>We almost didn't make it to Bacchanal, but we already parked and had some hungry kids on our hands.
12109<>xx<>To say it was great is an understatement, it was freakin fantastic, so delicious!!!
12110<>xx<>Everything was fresh, and I loved the way they served the food, fried chicken legs and sweet potato fries in a tiny fry basket, and truffle scalloped potatoes served in a tiny cast iron skillet!
12111<>xx<>The kids loved the fresh juices, and the deserts were great too!
12112<>xx<>Sadly they didn't have regular creme brulee, only chocolate, but the pecan bars were to die for!!
12113<>xx<>!
12114<>xx<>best buffet ever.
12115<>xx<>5/5  You should to go early or not during peak times or else you will be waiting in lines of +2hrs.
12116<>xx<>Part of the buffet of the buffet promotion, I think its worth it to pay the $25 surcharge as its still beats paying regular price.
12117<>xx<>They have a huge variety of foods from pho, udon, pad thai, ramen, fresher seafood, a vast dessert selection, unlimited mimosas, prime rib, a deep fryer section, creme brulee etc.
12118<>xx<>All the foods were above average and the service was top notch.
12119<>xx<>Basically its a must try if you are in vegas.
12120<>xx<>Just try and come early to avoid the frustrating wait times because everyone wants to go here.
12121<>xx<>This place is great.
12122<>xx<>Veggie pizza, Turkey Bolognese, kale Mac and cheese & the salted caramel ice cream for dessert are my go-tos.
12123<>xx<>Enjoy!
12124<>xx<>There are a few things that will make me give five stars.
12125<>xx<>The main reason being - they have some of the best pan seared scallops I've had anywhere.
12126<>xx<>This is a family owned business and you can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients.
12127<>xx<>Always a plus.
12128<>xx<>I had heard a lot of hype about this place, but I'm usually not to keen on the "new hip" place.
12129<>xx<>I hate going to newer restaurants when they're busy and just crowed with people.
12130<>xx<>Of course, that's what they want :) I've had a lot of people tell me that they like places just because they're new and cool - not because of the food.
12131<>xx<>So I was kind of nervous, especially because the food here is not on the cheaper side.
12132<>xx<>For dinner we had -   New England Fry - Clams and Calamari  Caramelized Sea Scallops Grass-fed Filet Mignon  Side of their well known Kale and Anaheim pepper Mac & Cheese  I will tell you, I was not disappointed with ANY of the dishes.
12133<>xx<>The clams and calamari were cooked perfectly and they weren't like rubber like you find at a lot of places around town.
12134<>xx<>The Scallops where amazing.
12135<>xx<>The had this vanilla bean cauliflower puree and true sauce that really made the dish absolutely delightful.
12136<>xx<>The mignon was cooked perfectly as asked and have a very distinguished taste.
12137<>xx<>And on to my favorite - the Mac & Cheese.
12138<>xx<>Never have I had kale in my mac & cheese, but my goodness...it was quite a charming surprise!
12139<>xx<>It has a nice spicy cheese sauce from the peppers and it so was nice and creamy.
12140<>xx<>Perfect combination!
12141<>xx<>They have a really nice "homey" feeling to the restaurant.
12142<>xx<>Very creative decor and they have good service.
12143<>xx<>They were booked, so if you go in when it's that busy, do expect a bit of a delay.
12144<>xx<>DEFINITELY make a reservation before going in for dinner.
12145<>xx<>They also have a large variety of specialty drinks!
12146<>xx<>I've heard amazing things about their chicken sandwich...I'm just not big on things like that for dinner.
12147<>xx<>Soooo that means I'll be going back for lunch soon.
12148<>xx<>Great atmosphere.
12149<>xx<>I love that they use "local, fresh" ingredients.
12150<>xx<>I do think that their prices are high compared to the portion size.
12151<>xx<>None the less, a favorite in town.
12152<>xx<>I loved the atmosphere of this place, very cozy!
12153<>xx<>In my opinion the food was ok, my company enjoyed it a little more than I did.
12154<>xx<>We started off with the calamari.
12155<>xx<>it was cooked perfectly not too chewy however, it was a bit too spicy.
12156<>xx<>I had the fried chicken sandwich, to me it was more like a chicken finger sandwich.
12157<>xx<>Not mind-blowing, not even mediocre if it werent for it being on a brioche I could get this same sandwich at McDonalds.
12158<>xx<>Seriously.
12159<>xx<>For dessert we had the bread pudding.
12160<>xx<>This was AMAZING!
12161<>xx<>absolutely delicious!
12162<>xx<>The service was excellent and we saw Nicholas Cage so it wasn't terrible but just ok.
12163<>xx<>Yes yes Honey Salt is new Yes yes it has a lot of good reviews Yes yes i had an excellent time  So what's wrong?
12164<>xx<>Well the Bang to Buck ratio is horribly tilted toward buck and not bang.
12165<>xx<>I ordered the 14 dollar 'Grain Power' with free-ranged chicken and what came out didnt exactly rate up to 14 dollars.
12166<>xx<>Was it good?
12167<>xx<>You bet your sweet ass it was good!
12168<>xx<>Some of the best tasting chicken i've had in a while.
12169<>xx<>Tasted like it was raised, killed, then grilled with love instead of cold and faceless with the intent of making money.
12170<>xx<>So what's wrong?
12171<>xx<>Well everything was just sooooooo and I actually left still kind of hungry but not hungry enough to shell out a few more bucks for something else.
12172<>xx<>Service could be improved as well.
12173<>xx<>One would think when you write down the orders for a large table you make little notes of who got what right then and there instead of making everyone wait...lets be nice and round down, 10 to 15 (probably a lot longer) while you sort out the bills.
12174<>xx<>After much hype about Honey Salt, I HAD to try it out.
12175<>xx<>The fact that the name is an oxymoron in and of itself was a plus as well!
12176<>xx<>There was zero wait on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, but it was still fairly busy.
12177<>xx<>I agree with others that the seating is a bit tight.
12178<>xx<>However, the decor is amazing and the fluffy pillows on the benches are so cute!
12179<>xx<>The bread basket had two tasty kinds to "choose" from (I put that in quotes since I ate them both).
12180<>xx<>I ordered the Biloxi Fried Chicken since it seemed to be the thing that everyone raved about most.
12181<>xx<>I was NOT disappointed.
12182<>xx<>Not sure if I can roll with the pickle thing though... the sandwich would have been just as good without them in my opinion.
12183<>xx<>I was in love with the sauce and slaw combo on the sandwich and felt that it really pulled it all together.
12184<>xx<>The chopped salad... no words.
12185<>xx<>I loved it.
12186<>xx<>Fiance opted for the Backyard Favorite Burger.
12187<>xx<>He said it was good, but really just like any other burger.
12188<>xx<>The fries were good (I know this is a fact, since I ate about half the basket myself).
12189<>xx<>He did agree that my meal was better than his.
12190<>xx<>Service is where the last star was lost.
12191<>xx<>While our server was very nice, he did let drinks run dry when they should not have been.
12192<>xx<>Other than that, Honey Salt is definitely worth returning to.
12193<>xx<>I also think that its location is absolutely perfect because it fits in well with the surrounding shops.
12194<>xx<>We discovered this restaurant on my Yelp app after looking for a new place for lunch in the Summerlin area.
12195<>xx<>I loved the shabby chic vintage look of the place and the very friendly waiters.
12196<>xx<>This place has almost a romantic feel to it and it's a very nice change from everything else in this city.
12197<>xx<>Hubby and I ordered a couple of flat breads and the burger.
12198<>xx<>They all were delicious and we gave our best to eat slow and enjoy.
12199<>xx<>Living in North Las Vegas, I'm sad that all the nice places are so far away from us.
12200<>xx<>But we will definitely keep this place in mind for next time we make a day trip to Summerlin.
12201<>xx<>Loved loved loved the decor!
12202<>xx<>I know this review is supposed to be for the food & service, but I was in love with the ambiance!
12203<>xx<>Very shabby chic/Pottery Barn-ish.
12204<>xx<>Ok onto the food, I ordered the infamous Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich, this has been compared to Chik-Fil-A, now I've only had Chik-Fil-A once and I don't remember it being life changing or having a craving for it, but this sandwich was very comforting, and I think I liked the chopped salad it came with better!
12205<>xx<>I shared my friends grilled cheese and I think I prefered her sandwich to mine (Im biased, I can eat cheese and bread ALL day ERRR day).
12206<>xx<>We tried the layered chocolate cake (loved the cardamom in it) and the brown bag apple pie, my favorite!
12207<>xx<>I didn't try any cocktails as they seemed a little too, I don't know the word, too much for me?
12208<>xx<>The ingredients scared me.
12209<>xx<>The service was great, the chef, manager, and several servers were checking on us constantly.
12210<>xx<>I can't wait to go back and try the dinner menu.
12211<>xx<>I would rate this as 3.5 stars solid, so since half stars aren't an option I'm going with 4 (because some of the things I didn't like are more of a personal preference thing.. more below.
12212<>xx<>Ate there with my husband on a Friday night with reservations.
12213<>xx<>At 6:45 the restaurant and bar both looked packed.
12214<>xx<>It's a small space, homey-feeling with brick walls and a medium to loud noise buzz.
12215<>xx<>We were seated near the open, very clean and efficient looking kitchen and between that and the dining room there was a long, sort of console type table where they finished the dishes (drizzle of oil, etc) before taking them to the diners, which I thought was a neat touch.
12216<>xx<>On to the food: I was really looking forward to the creamless corn soup with arugula oil, but was disappointed.
12217<>xx<>I know that corn has a sweetness to it but I really think that this dish had to have been augmented with sugar because it was way too sweet.
12218<>xx<>And other than that, nondescript; the arugula oil finish really didn't add anything to it or stand out as a contrast, so all I tasted was grainy sweetness.
12219<>xx<>I didn't even eat half of it, hubby had a few spoonfuls and even though he has a palate much more inclined to sweetness than mine he agreed that it was just too much so for a soup.
12220<>xx<>However, that was the "worst" thing we had all night..
12221<>xx<>The turkey meatball pizza he ordered was fantastic.
12222<>xx<>Great chewy/crispy ratio to the dough with the crust nicely blistered in a few spots, and the meatballs had great flavor.
12223<>xx<>My only beef (or should that be turkey) with the dish was that it said "shaved horseradish" on the menu as an aspect of the dish (and the server even issued a caveat when we ordered it "that has horseradish on it, is that ok?")
12224<>xx<>but I never even got a hint of it nor did he.
12225<>xx<>I'm not sure if they forgot to add it, or if it was so little and/or mild that it didn't come through, but I actually adore fresh horseradish and would have liked to taste it.
12226<>xx<>Maybe I'll ask for extra next time.
12227<>xx<>Along with his pizza he got the mac and cheese side which had kale and Anaheim chilies in it.
12228<>xx<>Man let me tell you, this was GOOD.
12229<>xx<>I usually avoid peppers because even the mild ones don't get along too well with my stomach, but somehow this had just the right amount of pepper flavor infused through the creamy yumminess and enhancing it as a whole.
12230<>xx<>I couldn't stop stealing bites of it, and repeated that performance when he heated up his leftovers the next day.
12231<>xx<>I'm not sure the kale added much, just small bits throughout but hey, it did make us feel virtuous for eating more vegetables.
12232<>xx<>My main course was the bucatini with fennel sausage, also very tasty.
12233<>xx<>I'm a sucker for bucatini when I see it on a menu, I like that toothiness (not really a word) that it gives being thicker and more substantial than spaghetti.
12234<>xx<>I think the fennel sausage might have been made in house, it had amazing flavor that reminded me of the Italian sausage I grew up on; mixed throughout the pasta in irregular size chunks rather than slices or crumbles.
12235<>xx<>Also had chopped broccolini which was tender-crisp, and was finished with pecorino cheese and just a very slight heat from red pepper flakes.
12236<>xx<>I would definitely order this again.
12237<>xx<>I'm in fact eating the leftovers now as I write this review..
12238<>xx<>I wasn't too pleased with the dessert that I ordered to go and tucked into later that evening.
12239<>xx<>It was billed as a "coconut chocolate layer cake", and I freaking LOVE coconut cake, and never see it anywhere.
12240<>xx<>It turned out to be a chocolate cake with some coconut filling/flavoring between the layers.
12241<>xx<>Minor thing I guess, but when you are expecting one thing and get another it's disappointing; I certainly could have asked for clarification before ordering though.
12242<>xx<>The cake was just ok, not particularly memorable and just a touch dry.
12243<>xx<>Hubby finished that off for me the next day.
12244<>xx<>They had a good beer selection and wine list, we had the Estrella Damm Spanish beer that ended up going really well with the food we'd ordered.
12245<>xx<>Minus points for the busser taking away my husband's 2nd glass of beer as the meal wrapped up, before it was empty.
12246<>xx<>Pet peeve!
12247<>xx<>In general the service was very good though, friendly and brisk but not too obtrusive and a manager stopped by our table to check on our meal as well.
12248<>xx<>Overall:  neat place, liked the vibe, most of the food and a lot of the little touches.
12249<>xx<>In cooler weather we'll return to sit on the patio and try some of the other dishes that sounded very delicious including the backyard burger and the charcuterie pizza.
12250<>xx<>been a couple times for dinner.
12251<>xx<>highlights:  nice space, good looking clientel, cold beer, decent service, excellent bread pudding.
12252<>xx<>the not so great:  i didn't care for the flavors in the meatball appetizer, the bean soup had no flavor (i kept adding salt and pepper, but if you don't season the soup throughout the cooking process it will never have the flavor it should.
12253<>xx<>cooking the beans in pancetta and rosemary would certainly do the trick), the chicken also lacked seasoning the second time i ate it (first experience with the chicken nearly provided a foodgasm), margarita pizza was good but a little doughy.
12254<>xx<>the cookie plate dessert  was a failure but i appreciate the attempt (at least they don't have dognuts in a brown bag on the menu).
12255<>xx<>I feel like I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but decided to give it a 4 star rating.
12256<>xx<>It's located inside Planet Hollywood.
12257<>xx<>WAIT: Make sure you know, the line of people is for groups of 2, if you have a bigger group you have to "check in" at the front and it's usually an hour or so wait, because the restaurant isn't always filled, when we ate we saw there were empty tables...
12258<>xx<>ATMOSPHERE: More casual, open kitchen, with a modern feel.
12259<>xx<>FOOD: I got the farm burger (egg!)
12260<>xx<>and got it medium rare.
12261<>xx<>I also got the truffle fries and the other people in my group got the sweet potato and regular fries.
12262<>xx<>Each of the fries comes with their own two dipping sauces (ketchup, aioli, truffle sauce etc.)
12263<>xx<>and they come in those cone like containers.
12264<>xx<>The fries are cut fatter than normal, which I didn't really like.
12265<>xx<>The truffle fries were good, I just wish they were thinner.
12266<>xx<>The sauce it came with totally made it though.
12267<>xx<>They sprinkle some cheese on top too.
12268<>xx<>My burger was good, the patty was tasty and flavorful - definitely glad I went with medium rare.
12269<>xx<>The egg could use a little more seasoning but it was perfectly soft and the yolk spilled out when I poked into it.
12270<>xx<>The bacon was interesting, it was softer and not crunchy (I think it was duck something bacon?)
12271<>xx<>and the bun was the most disappointing.
12272<>xx<>It looked good but it was kinda meh, just your typical bread bun, not really toasted or chewy like Umami's buns.
12273<>xx<>Overall, not a bad burger if you're in PH or want to try Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.
12274<>xx<>They can be a little pricey around $13 for mine I think.
12275<>xx<>Size wise, they tend to be a little smaller, the guys in the group ate it quickly but I felt like with the fries it filled me up perfectly.
12276<>xx<>let me start off by saying my girlfriend and i love gordon ramsay and we went to burgr on a saturday night for my bday.we started off by ordering 1 of my personal favorites (jalapeno poppers).
12277<>xx<>now these were no ordinary jalapeno poppers!
12278<>xx<>the appearance of the poppers in their own shotglass filled with a cheddar bacon sauce/dip was just awesome.out of the 6 poppers u get they leave the seeds in 1,so its up to you to bite down and find that 1 firery surprise.the next thing we ordered was the truffle fries, now the truffle were awesome and had a unique taste that you cant find anywhere else.i personally liked them but my girlfriend wasent too fond of them.next time were getting the onion rings....
12279<>xx<>ok!!!
12280<>xx<>now to the burgrs!!
12281<>xx<>the burgrs we ordered were the blue burger and the hells kitchen burger.
12282<>xx<>both were  exceedingly amazing!!
12283<>xx<>my blue cheese burger was exactly what i wanted which is blue cheese and arugula,simple and pleasing.
12284<>xx<>now my girlfriends hells kitchen burger was also amazing and had a burst of flavors you cant get at any other burger joint period!!
12285<>xx<>so if you are thinking about goin to burgr in planet hollywood, you better go!
12286<>xx<>the food is amazing and exceeds your expectations.
12287<>xx<>the atmosphere is relaxed and exciting at the sametime.
12288<>xx<>and the staff are nice and talkative.
12289<>xx<>to be honest chef ramsay never messes it up and i never expected anything less than awesome at his restaurant's.
12290<>xx<>Finally!!
12291<>xx<>I get to eat a burger.
12292<>xx<>It's been 40 days and 40 nights since I had some red meat.
12293<>xx<>I admit, I am a carnivore and giving up red meat was no easy task.
12294<>xx<>So what is the first thing I'm craving?
12295<>xx<>A burger, of course.
12296<>xx<>So, BurGR it is.
12297<>xx<>Service:   Unique situation when we arrived for dinner.
12298<>xx<>It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.
12299<>xx<>Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time.
12300<>xx<>Not a big deal to me.
12301<>xx<>Safety first, right?
12302<>xx<>Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.
12303<>xx<>Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.
12304<>xx<>So far, so good.
12305<>xx<>The Food: -American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.
12306<>xx<>But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.
12307<>xx<>So, I had them add an extra patty.
12308<>xx<>This was perfect, this was huge.
12309<>xx<>My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.
12310<>xx<>My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.
12311<>xx<>The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger.
12312<>xx<>I managed to eat the whole thing.
12313<>xx<>Obviously, I was satisfied.
12314<>xx<>Obviously, I recommend.
12315<>xx<>-Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.
12316<>xx<>But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.
12317<>xx<>I thought that these were pretty good.
12318<>xx<>They hook up the fries here.
12319<>xx<>It's big enough for 4.
12320<>xx<>-Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good.
12321<>xx<>I thought that they were just okay.
12322<>xx<>Maybe it's the batch that we got.
12323<>xx<>I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.
12324<>xx<>Still tasted good, though.
12325<>xx<>Overall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.
12326<>xx<>Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.
12327<>xx<>PS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.
12328<>xx<>I had a great time and we all deMELished our burgers.
12329<>xx<>The place is good with beautiful waitresses and the food is amazing!
12330<>xx<>The cocktails were good too especially the slimy screw...wow!
12331<>xx<>Must go for the cute waitresses at least ;-)
12332<>xx<>My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans so when we saw the restaurant as we walked the strip we had to stop in.
12333<>xx<>It was noon and the line was a bit long, however the wait was only 20 minutes.
12334<>xx<>This might indicate that they were churning out customers, however that was not the case at all.
12335<>xx<>We spent time talking to the hostess, waiter and manager, however Gordon wasn't there.
12336<>xx<>We missed him by 2 days.
12337<>xx<>I was hung over so I opted for the Farm Burger which included an egg and duck breast bacon.
12338<>xx<>Perfect.
12339<>xx<>We also enjoyed onion rings which were the best I have ever eaten.
12340<>xx<>My only regret was that I was only able to finish 1/2 of my beer.
12341<>xx<>30 on tap.
12342<>xx<>The service, food, prices and atmosphere are excellent for a casual meal.
12343<>xx<>With so many choices in Vegas to eat its hard to go wrong, however I do not give out 5 stars often and BurGR well deserves all 5.
12344<>xx<>One of the best burgers I've ever had!
12345<>xx<>Ordered the Blue Burger, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly.
12346<>xx<>I've eaten at 25 Degrees, Lucky Devils, Umami Burger, The Apple Pan, The Counter, Pie n'Burger, and several other known burger joints and  am torn between 25 Degrees and BurGR for the best burger award.
12347<>xx<>We also had Shake #3, which was great as were the sweet potato fries (minus the bland dipping sauce, thumbs up for the vanilla sugar side).
12348<>xx<>My reason for 4 and not 5 stars was not because of the food, but that we some how managed to get the night with the worst service ever!
12349<>xx<>Waited a while to order after being seated, waitress was no where in sight frequently, the food took a while to hit the table, had to ask for refills, and several other minor issues that good service would have negated.
12350<>xx<>Wait was 1 hour 20 mins for a party of 2 on a Sunday night around 6:45p, but did like the text paging that they over here, as do several other restaurants now days.
12351<>xx<>Overall the food was outstanding and unfortunately the service was poor.
12352<>xx<>This is the best place ever for an amazing dining experience!
12353<>xx<>Make sure to ask for Alex with the glasses as your server.
12354<>xx<>His knowledge of the menu is beyond compare, making your dining experience customized and one of a kind!
12355<>xx<>Definately am coming back for lunch!
12356<>xx<>Since Ramsey is such a perfectionist I went into this place looking to critique everything!!
12357<>xx<>The bottom line- I couldn't complain about anything!!!!
12358<>xx<>The ambiance, the service, the accommodating attitude, the presentation, the quality of food , the taste-  all were as good as it gets!!
12359<>xx<>This place as been thought out  and executed to perfection!!!
12360<>xx<>WAY TO GO RAMSEY-  Someone that walks the talk.
12361<>xx<>Si vous cherchez un bon restaurant pour manger sur la 'strip' à Las Vegas, Burgr est une excellente option.
12362<>xx<>C'est parmi mes restaurants favoris de Las Vegas.
12363<>xx<>Ce n'est pas cher, c'est beau, une belle ambiance, des jolies serveuses, et surtout, des excellents hamburgers!
12364<>xx<>Côté bières, il y a même une 'Fin du monde' en fût avec moins d'alcool que celle au Québec, qui la rend encore meilleure à mon avis!
12365<>xx<>Le burger Hell's Kichen est super, et j'ai ADORÉ le Hog Burger, fait avec du porc.
12366<>xx<>Recommandation: ne pas les prendre trop cuit, la qualité de la viande est excellente, ce qui permet de les manger moins cuits et ainsi mieux goûter la viande.
12367<>xx<>Comme Jessy a écrit, les frites au parmesan aux truffes sont succulentes!
12368<>xx<>Et une portion est suffisante pour deux personnes!
12369<>xx<>After watching all of Gordon Ramsey's tv shows, I had high expectations for Burgr.
12370<>xx<>We tried the Farm Burger which had the duck bacon and the egg.
12371<>xx<>I normally put egg in most of my sandwiches so it would make it more rich.
12372<>xx<>But with that, the burger was bland.
12373<>xx<>the burger definitely needed cheese or something salty to balance out the neutral taste of an egg (like how eggs always need salt/pepper, soy sauce).
12374<>xx<>For me the flavor of the burger was lacking in that department.
12375<>xx<>I rarely say it but it def needed a tad more sodium :/   My group shared order of sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries.
12376<>xx<>Truffle Parmesan Fries: I was expecting to love this but it was soggy and a bit colder than fries should be.
12377<>xx<>I was disappointed that it was so soggy.
12378<>xx<>and the flavors did not seem to come through for me.
12379<>xx<>I barely detected any truffle.
12380<>xx<>Sweet Potato fries: I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful these fries were!
12381<>xx<>The vanilla powdered sugar really boosted the flavor of the sweet potato!
12382<>xx<>It was scrumptious and I normally don't like sweet potato fries very much.
12383<>xx<>:] MUST try this!
12384<>xx<>All in all, for the price, it's still pretty hefty for a burger but it's vegas.
12385<>xx<>:/ I would definitely try something different the next time I come here.
